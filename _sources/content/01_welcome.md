## Aim and research questions:

The overarching research aim is determine to what extent authors of DES health studies share models and where models are shared how is this done.

### Primary research questions:

1. What proportion of DES healthcare studies share code? 
2. How is sharing affected by FOSS, Covid-19, publication type and year of publication?
3. What proportion of studies make use of a reporting guideline?
4. What methods, tools, and resources did authors use to share their computer models and code?
5. To what extent do the DES health community follow best practice for open science when sharing computer models?
6. To what extent can the healthcare DES community improve its sharing of computer models?
