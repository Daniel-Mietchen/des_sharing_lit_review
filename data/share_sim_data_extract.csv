In order to better estimate future demands and adequate resources for coping with such demands, statistical and computerised modelling can be applied. This can then allow healthcare administrators and decision makers to quantify the impacts of various 'what-if' scenarios on hospital performance measures. This paper investigates the application of Discrete Event Simulation towards optimising Emergency Department resources while measuring overall length of stay and queuing time of emergency patients as a target performance measure. In particular, we explore strategies for generating historically informed synthetic data that helps the simulation model track patient flow through the target hospital over a future time frame. Using the developed simulation model, several resource configurations are tested using data from one of the busiest emergency departments in the state of Queensland as the baseline while quantifying the impacts of such changes on key patient flow metrics. It was found that adding a single bed (and associated resources) to the emergency department would result in a 23% decrease in average patient treatment delay. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:34:01,,,32,,276,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,Pages: 37 DOI: 10.3233/SHTI210007,,,,patient flow; Discrete Event Simulation; bed optimisation; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,SimPy,1,,,,,,,,

In these cases, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) face significant challenges due to the complex nature of pre-hospital events, coordinating several resources according to the collected information in a short time. In this context, both agent-based and discrete event simulation seem to be excellent approaches to find new strategies for facing this complexity. However, there are some challenges presented in the modeling process seeking an accurate representation of the reality. In this work, we introduce a general process of pre-hospital emergency services, a hybrid simulation model based on the general process, and a machine learning approach for key simulation parameters. Our general process benefits from an intensive exchange with a multidisciplinary group of experts from medicine, including practitioners, paramedics, coordination center managers, and stakeholders, among others. Furthermore, we validated our simulation model using real-world data from an emergency coordination center from North Germany. In addition, we introduce a machine learning approach for travel speed forecasting, using seven parameters for more accuracy. Finally, we present an application of our model to analyze critical crew capacity in the coordination center. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:11:37,,,,,109,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Hybrid simulation; Discrete-event simulation; Agent-based simulation; German EMS system; Rescue chain; Hybrid; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,AnyLogic,0,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to use big data simulations of a patient scheduling calendar and its effect on TWT in a general ophthalmology clinic. Based on the simulation, we implemented changes to the calendar and verified their effect on TWT in clinical practice. Design and methods: For this retrospective simulation study, we generated a discrete event simulation (DES) model based on clinical timepoints of 4.401 visits to our clinic. All data points were exported from our clinical warehouse for further processing. If not available from the electronic health record, manual time measurements of the process were used. Various patient scheduling models were simulated and evaluated based on their reduction of TWT. The most promising model was implemented into clinical practice in 2017. Results: During validation of our simulation model, we achieved a high agreement of mean TWT between the real data (229 ± 100 min) and the corresponding simulated data (225 ± 112 min). This indicates a high quality of the simulation model. Following the simulations, a patient scheduling calendar was introduced, which, compared with the old calendar, provided block intervals and extended time windows for patients. The simulated TWT of this model was 153 min. After implementation in clinical practice, TWT per patient in our general ophthalmology clinic has been reduced from 229 ± 100 to 183 ± 89 min. Conclusion: By implementing a big data simulation model, we have achieved a cost-neutral reduction of the mean TWT by 21%. Big data simulation enables users to evaluate variations to an existing system before implementation into clinical practice. Various models for improving patient flow or reducing capacity loads can be evaluated cost-effectively.

Methods: To compare the operational feasibility and cost implications of manufacturing autologous chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T)-cell products between centralized and decentralized schemes, a discrete event simulation model was built using ExtendSIM 9 for simulating the patient-to-patient supply chain, from the collection of patient cells to the final administration of CAR T therapy in hospitals. Simulations were carried out for hypothetical systems in the UK using three demand levels—low (100 patients per annum), anticipated (200 patients per annum) and high (500 patients per annum)—to assess resource allocation, cost per treatment and system resilience to demand changes and to quantify the risks of mix-ups within the supply chain for the delivery of CAR T treatments. Results: The simulation results show that although centralized manufacturing offers better economies of scale, individual facilities in a decentralized system can spread facility costs across a greater number of treatments and better utilize resources at high demand levels (annual demand of 500 patients), allowing for an overall more comparable cost per treatment. In general, raw material and consumable costs have been shown to be one of the greatest cost drivers, and genetic modification-associated costs have been shown to account for over one third of raw material and consumable costs. Turnaround time per treatment for the decentralized scheme is shown to be consistently lower than its centralized counterpart, as there is no need for product freeze-thaw, packaging and transportation, although the time savings is shown to be insignificant in the UK case study because of its rather compact geographical setting with well-established transportation networks. In both schemes, sterility testing lies on the critical path for treatment delivery and is shown to be critical for treatment turnaround time reduction. Conclusions: Considering both cost and treatment turnaround time, point-of-care manufacturing within the UK does not show great advantages over centralized manufacturing. However, further simulations using this model can be used to understand the feasibility of decentralized manufacturing in a larger geographical setting. © 2020 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 16:24:59,,433-451,,5,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; CAR T; centralization; decentralization; manufacturing; supply chain; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,ExtendSim,0,,,,,,,,

Through an application in pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing to guide drug selection for individuals with a genetic variant, we assessed model accuracy, optimal decisions, and computation time for an identical decision scenario modeled 4 ways: using 1) coupled-time differential equations (DEQ), 2) a cohort-based discrete-time state transition model (MARKOV), 3) an individual discrete-time state transition microsimulation model (MICROSIM), and 4) discrete event simulation (DES). Relative to DEQ, the net monetary benefit for PGx testing (v. a reference strategy of no testing) based on MARKOV with rate-to-probability conversions using commonly used formulas resulted in different optimal decisions. MARKOV was nearly identical to DEQ when transition probabilities were embedded using a transition intensity matrix. Among stochastic models, DES model outputs converged to DEQ with substantially fewer simulated patients (1 million) v. MICROSIM (1 billion). Overall, properly embedded Markov models provided the most favorable mix of accuracy and runtime but introduced additional complexity for calculating cost and quality-adjusted life year outcomes due to the inclusion of “jumpover” states after proper embedding of transition probabilities. Among stochastic models, DES offered the most favorable mix of accuracy, reliability, and speed. © The Author(s) 2021.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 16:25:21,,453-464,,4,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,decision modeling; health economic methods; pharmacogenomics; Yes,0,1,1,1,None,0,R,1,,,PDF,,,,,The code appears to be embeeded in a LaTeX produced PDf

Crowding can potentially be eased through streamlining and the reduction of duplication in patient history-taking through the use of a digital symptom-taking app. Objective: We simulated the introduction of a digital symptom-taking app on patient flow. We hypothesized that waiting times and crowding in an urgent care center (UCC) could be reduced, and that this would be more efficient than simply adding more staff. Methods: A discrete-event approach was used to simulate patient flow in a UCC during a 4-hour time frame. The baseline scenario was a small UCC with 2 triage nurses, 2 doctors, 1 treatment/examination nurse, and 1 discharge administrator in service. We simulated 33 scenarios with different staff numbers or different potential time savings through the app. We explored average queue length, waiting time, idle time, and staff utilization for each scenario. Results: Discrete-event simulation showed that even a few minutes saved through patient app-based self-history recording during triage could result in significantly increased efficiency. A modest estimated time saving per patient of 2.5 minutes decreased the average patient wait time for triage by 26.17%, whereas a time saving of 5 minutes led to a 54.88% reduction in patient wait times. Alternatively, adding an additional triage nurse was less efficient, as the additional staff were only required at the busiest times. Conclusions: Small time savings in the history-taking process have potential to result in substantial reductions in total patient waiting time for triage nurses, with likely effects of reduced patient anxiety, staff anxiety, and improved patient care. Patient self-history recording could be carried out at home or in the waiting room via a check-in kiosk or a portable tablet computer. This formative simulation study has potential to impact service provision and approaches to digitalization at scale. © Maryam Montazeri, Jan Multmeier, Claire Novorol, Shubhanan Upadhyay, Paul Wicks, Stephen Gilbert.

Objective We present a new agent-based model (ABM) called the Discrete-Event, Simulated Social Agent based Network Transmission model (DESSABNeT) and demonstrate its ability to model the spread of COVID-19 in large cities like Sydney, Melbourne and Gold Coast. Our aim was to validate the model with its disease dynamics and underlying social network. Design DESSABNeT relies on disease transmission within simulated social networks. It employs an epidemiological SEIRD+M (Susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, died and managed) structure. One hundred simulations were run for each city, with simulated social restrictions closely modelling real restrictions imposed in each location. Main outcome(s) and measure(s) The mean predicted daily incidence of COVID-19 cases were compared to real case incidence data for each city. Reff and health service utilisation outputs were compared to the literature, or for the Gold Coast with daily incidence of hospitalisation. Results DESSABNeT modelled multiple physical distancing restrictions and predicted epidemiological outcomes of Sydney, Melbourne and the Gold Coast, validating this model for future simulation work. Conclusions and relevance DESSABNeT is a valid platform to model the spread of COVID-19 in large cities in Australia and potentially internationally. The platform is suitable to model different combinations of social restrictions, or to model contact tracing, predict, and plan for, the impact on hospital and ICU admissions, and deaths; and also the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and optimal social restrictions during vaccination. © 2021 Stapelberg et al.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 15:14:19,,,,5 May,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Hybrid; Yes,0,1,1,1,None,1,MatLab,0,,GitHub,,,,,,

The gap between providers and demanders are always existing and becoming more and more sensitive in some densely populated areas. If resources of P.E. departments are regarded as nodes, then each path selected by patients will constitute a small world network. Furthermore, with respect to traditional research concentrating on the feature between nodes in network, adaptive collaboration (AC) is in fact an important method to improve the group performance of the whole system in the small world network. Based on these, this paper deals with this kind of problem with respect to the scenario of P.E., which attempts to help decision makers of the health center to schedule limited resources and improve a patient's satisfaction and the system performance. It firstly abstracts a medical examination by Role-Based Collaboration (RBC) and its general model E-CARGO. The adaptive collaboration model is constructed by system states and optimized via series of group role assignments (GRAs), which is a subtask of RBC, and it can be accomplished by linear programming. All the proposed methods are verified by simulation experiments, and the team performance is improved via adaptation of the assignment strategies, which provides a new insight into the small world study. © 2021 IEEE.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 15:22:08,,546-551,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,adaptive collaboration (AC); discrete events simulation; E-CARGO; group role assignment (GRA); physical examination (P.E.); role-based collaboration (RBC); scheduling; small world network; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,C++,0,,,,,,,,

Empagliflozin reduced major adverse CV event (MACE) by 14%, CV death by 38%, and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) by 35% vs placebo, each on top of standard of care (SoC). SGLT-2 inhibitors canagliflozin and dapagliflozin have also been compared with placebo, all on top of SoC, in CV outcome trials. In the CANVAS (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study) Program, canagliflozin reduced MACE by 14% and HHF by 33%. Dapagliflozin reduced HHF by 27% in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial (Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on the Incidence of Cardiovascular Events). This analysis estimated the cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin versus canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or SoC, in US adults with T2DM and established CV disease. Research design and methods Individual patient-level discrete-event simulation was conducted to predict time-to-event for CV and renal outcomes, and specific adverse events over patients' lifetimes. Occurrence of events in EMPA-REG OUTCOME was estimated based on event-free survival curves with time-dependent covariates. An HR for canagliflozin or dapagliflozin versus empagliflozin on each clinical event was estimated from published CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI 58, and EMPA-REG OUTCOME data using indirect treatment comparison. Public sources provided US costs and utilities. Results The model predicted longer survival for empagliflozin versus canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and SoC mainly due to direct reduction in CV death. Empagliflozin dominated canagliflozin, yielding more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; 0.38) at a lower cost (-US$306). Compared with dapagliflozin and SoC, empagliflozin yielded 0.50 and 0.84 incremental QALYs at US$1517 and US$27 539 incremental costs, yielding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US$3054/QALY and US$32 848/QALY, respectively. Conclusions Empagliflozin was projected to dominate canagliflozin and be highly cost-effective compared with dapagliflozin and SoC using US healthcare costs. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 16:37:05,,,,1,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,cost effectiveness; cardiovascular system; sodium glucose cotransporter; type 2 diabetes; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Excel,0,,,,,,Yes,,"On request talks about data rather than the model, but could mean the same thing."

Methods We were tasked to construct and evaluate COVID-19 driven predictive models to identify possible planning and resource utilisation scenarios. We used system dynamics to derive a series of chain susceptible, infected and recovered (SIR) models. We then built a discrete event simulation using the system dynamics output and bootstrapped electronic medical record data to approximate the weekly effect of tuning surgical volume on hospital census. We evaluated performance via a model fit assessment and cross-model comparison. Results We outlined the design and implementation of predictive models to support management decision making around areas impacted by COVID-19. The fit assessments indicated the models were most useful after 30 days from onset of local cases. We found our subreports were most accurate up to 7 days after model run. Discusssion Our model allowed us to shape our health system's executive policy response to implement a € hospital within a hospital' - one for patients with COVID-19 within a hospital able to care for the regular non-COVID-19 population. The surgical scheduleis modified according to models that predict the number of new patients withCovid-19 who require admission. This enabled our hospital to coordinateresources to continue to support the community at large. Challenges includedthe need to frequently adjust or create new models to meet rapidly evolvingrequirements, communication, and adoption, and to coordinate the needs ofmultiple stakeholders. The model we created can be adapted to other health systems,provide a mechanism to predict local peaks in cases and inform hospitalleadership regarding bed allocation, surgical volumes, staffing, and suppliesone for COVID-19 patients within a hospital able to care for the regularnon-COVID-19 population.

Through coordination of an upper-level hospital (ULH) and a lower-level hospital (LLH), ULH-referrals are encouraged so that the ULH can transfer less urgent patients to the LLH to alleviate the utilization imbalance. To the entire system, the patient referral coordination is dependent not only on the agreed transfer quantity but perhaps more on the patient flow characteristics and simultaneously mutual decisions from both the ULH and the LLH. In this paper, we thus investigate a control agreement framework between the ULH and the LLH that helps both hospitals to maximize their respective benefits. More specifically, a control agreement framework allows each hospital applies a threshold-based policy to make decisions on either referral (by ULH) or acceptance (by LLH). And a Pareto-based negotiation process is proposed to carry out the control agreement. To optimize the threshold pair from both hospitals, we formulate a Pareto optimization problem with objectives being revenue-and-monetarized-patient-blockage related benefits of the two hospitals. Given the complexity in analyzing patient flows of the system, we develop a multi-fidelity model-based optimization approach, which integrates the advantages of queueing model and discrete event simulation. Specifically, we adopt the idea of ordinal transformation and optimal sampling. In a real-world case study, we investigate the control policy in light of the referral coordination practice between Shanghai No. 6 People's Hospital and No. 8 People's Hospital. Our Pareto-optimization approach is applicable to many service systems with waiting time sensitive customers. Our work provides a novel perspective of operational level coordination design for the service outsourcing/sharing management literature. © 2020",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:33:21,,,,,101,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Control agreement framework; Healthcare coordination; Multi-Fidelity Model; Pareto Optimization; Patient referral; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,

The simulation of the health care has been done by arena master development 14-version software. The performance measurement for this study are patients output, service rate, service efficiency and it is directly related to waiting time of patients in each service station, work in progress, resource utilization. Simulation model was building for Bahir Dar clinic and then, prepared the proposed model for the system. Based on the simulation model run result, the output of the existing healthcare service system is low due to presence of bottlenecks on the service system. Moreover, the station with the largest queue and high resource utilization are identified as a bottleneck. The bottlenecks, which have identified are reduced by using reassigning the existing resources and add new resources and merging the similar services, which has under low resource utilization (nurses). Finally, the researchers have proposed a developed model from different scenarios. Moreover, the best scenario is developed by combining scenario 2 and 3. And then, service efficiency of the healthcare has increased by 9.86 percent, the work in progress (WIP) are reduced by 3 patients from the system and the service capacity of the system is increased 34 to 40 patients per day due to the reduction of bottleneck stations. © 2021 Qazvin Islamic Azad University.

Responding to a growing demand for maintenance, on one hand, and lack of proper maintenance management systems, on the other, has led to delays in repair and maintenance of the building components and systems in hospitals. Such delays could cause significant distress to patients and health care personnel. This paper introduces a new method for facility managers to address these challenges. The multimethod simulation approach is developed to integrate segmented information at different levels of maintenance management, with the aim of minimizing maintenance delays in hospital buildings. The developed simulation model consists of two components: a status tracking system (STS) and a resource allocation system (RAS). A discrete event simulation (DES) is used to simulate the maintenance process flow while a multi-agent system (MAS) is used to simulate the process of allocating resources for maintenance activities in hospital buildings. The STS simulation is a DES process that registers, arranges, and distributes maintenance tasks (orders) to the appropriate resources. For the RAS component, a multi-agent resource allocation system (MARAS) is developed to simulate different resource allocation scenarios, accounting for interactions among various agents (decision-makers) in the maintenance process. A case example is presented to demonstrate the essential features of the developed method. The simulation results show that the implementation of MARAS significantly reduces maintenance delays in the case study. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 15:28:20,,,,2,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Hospitals; Scheduling; Decision support systems; Maintenance; Resource allocation; Facilities management; Multi-agent systems; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,AnyLogic,0,,,,,,,,The authors state that the models are available in the article.

Hospitals throughout the world made life-altering resource allocation decisions and prioritised the care of COVID-19 patients. Without effective models to evaluate resource allocation strategies encompassing COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 care, hospitals face the risk of making sub-optimal local resource allocation decisions. A discrete-event-simulation model is proposed in this paper to describe COVID-19, elective surgery, and emergency surgery patient flows. COVID-19-specific patient flows and a surgical patient flow network were constructed based on data of 475 COVID-19 patients and 28,831 non-COVID-19 patients in Addenbrooke’s hospital in the UK. The model enabled the evaluation of three resource allocation strategies, for two COVID-19 wave scenarios: proactive cancellation of elective surgery, reactive cancellation of elective surgery, and ring-fencing operating theatre capacity. The results suggest that a ring-fencing strategy outperforms the other strategies, regardless of the COVID-19 scenario, in terms of total direct deaths and the number of surgeries performed. However, this does come at the cost of 50% more critical care rejections. In terms of aggregate hospital performance, a reactive cancellation strategy prioritising COVID-19 is no longer favourable if more than 7.3% of elective surgeries can be considered life-saving. Additionally, the model demonstrates the impact of timely hospital preparation and staff availability, on the ability to treat patients during a pandemic. The model can aid hospitals worldwide during pandemics and disasters, to evaluate their resource allocation strategies and identify the effect of redefining the prioritisation of patients. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 15:29:59,,356-374,,2,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,COVID-19; Simulation; Capacity management; Intensive care; Operations research; Resource allocation; Yes,0,1,1,1,None,1,Arena,0,Research Square;,,,,,,,Healthcare mgyt science hid the supp files!

A tool is needed that can proactively test these changes — Discrete Event Simulation (DES) may help. While computerized simulation models have existed before, there remains a gap to affirm the validity of these models. Objective: Develop an approach to creating a valid computerized simulation model that quantifies the effects of operational decisions on nurse-workload and quality-of-care. Methods: The DES model simulates the process of care delivery for nurses on a task-by-task basis. In an effort to validate this approach, the DES model was adapted to a real-world medical-surgical unit. Model inputs include: historical patient-care data; unit-layout; and programming logic, developed via focus-groups. Nurse-workload outcomes were distance-walked, task-in-queue, direct-care time, and nurse-movement. Quality-of-care outcomes included missed-care; and care-task waiting-time. The model is validated via internal validity checks and a field study that consisted of a ‘step-counter study’, a ‘MISSCARE survey’, ‘nurse job shadowing’, and a ‘time and motion study’. An Intraclass-correlation (ICC) and Spearman ranked correlation analysis were used to compare modelling outcomes to field-study outcomes. Results: The DES model, when adapted to a real-world medical-surgical unit, has been validated. The ICC coefficients show an “excellent” agreement of 0.99, 0.99, 0.85, 0.85, 0.84 between simulation and real-world outcomes, along with a “good” agreement of 0.86 for Spearman ranked correlation. Specific modelling results include a ‘distance walked’ of 7 to 10.6 km with a ‘direct care time’ of 8.3 to 10.4 h with a total of 77 to 84 trips for an average of 12 to 15 ‘tasks in queue’. Quality-of-care was represented by a ‘care task waiting time’ of 0.9 to 1 h that lead to 25 to 31 ‘missed-care’ tasks, where, 27% were ‘non-patient care’; and ‘missed-care delivery time’ was 2 to 2.9 h. Conclusion: This research provides a decision support-system that can help test and inform healthcare system policies that support both care quality and safety. By validating the DES model of a medical-surgical unit, we suggest that the modelling approach will also yield valid result when applied in similar settings. However, the modelling approach needs to be adapted to other healthcare settings and tested before concluding that this approach will consistently yield valid models. © 2021",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 16:47:26,,,,,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Human factors; Discrete Event Simulation; Operations research; Healthcare ergonomics; Decision support; Model validation; Workload measurement; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

Design: The authors used a discrete event simulation (DES) model to represent a hypothetical GP practice of 10,000 patients. Costs were measured from the perspective of the NHS and society. Outcomes were predicted waiting times, the total number of patients with musculoskeletal conditions who received physiotherapy and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, each estimated over a one year period. Model inputs were based on a pilot cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in four general practices in Cheshire, UK, and other sources from the literature. Results: Direct access could increase the number of patients receiving at least one physiotherapy appointment by 63%, but without investment in extra physiotherapist capacity would increase waiting time dramatically. The increase in activity is associated with a cost of £4999 per QALY gained. Conclusions: Direct access to physiotherapy services would be cost-effective and benefit patients given current cost per QALY thresholds used in England. This is because physiotherapy itself is cost-effective, rather than through savings in GP time. Direct access without an increase in supply of physiotherapists would increase waiting times and would be unlikely to be cost saving for the NHS owing to the likely increase in the use of physiotherapy services. © 2021",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 16:55:56,,40-47,,,111,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; Cost-effectiveness; Economic evaluation; Musculoskeletal; Physiotherapy; Self-referral; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,R Simmer,1,,,,,,,,

The programme monitors those with an aneurysm, and early intervention for large aneurysms reduces ruptures and AAA-related mortality. AAA screening services have been disrupted following COVID-19 but it is not known how this may impact AAA-related mortality, or where efforts should be focussed as services resume. Methods We repurposed a previously validated discrete event simulation model to investigate the impact of COVID-19-related service disruption on key outcomes. This model was used to explore the impact of delayed invitation and reduced attendance in men invited to screening. Additionally, we investigated the impact of temporarily suspending scans, increasing the threshold for elective surgery to 7cm and increasing drop-out in the AAA cohort under surveillance, using data from NAAASP to inform the population. Findings Delaying invitation to primary screening up to two years had little impact on key outcomes whereas a 10% reduction in attendance could lead to a 2% lifetime increase in AAA-related deaths. In surveillance patients, a 1-year suspension of surveillance or increase in the elective threshold resulted in a 0.4% increase in excess AAA-related deaths (8% in those 5–5.4cm at the start). Longer suspensions or a doubling of drop-out from surveillance would have a pronounced impact on outcomes. Interpretation Efforts should be directed towards encouraging men to attend AAA screening service appointments post-COVID-19. Those with AAAs on surveillance should be prioritised as the screening programme resumes, as changes to these services beyond one year are likely to have a larger impact on surgical burden and AAA-related mortality. © 2021 Public Library of Science.

Many people turn their lives upside down from day to day. Politicians had to impose completely unprecedented measures, and doctors immediately had to adapt to the huge influx of patients and the massive demand for testing. Of course, not all processes could be planned completely efficiently, given that the situation literally changes from minute to minute, but sometimes better planning could improve the real processes. This contribution deals with the application of simulation software SIMUL8 to the analysis of the COVID-19 sample collection process in a drive-in point in a hospital. The main aim is to create a model based on the real data and then to find out the suitable number of other staff (medics) helping a doctor during the process to decrease the number of unattended patients and their waiting times. © ECMS Khalid Al-Begain, Mauro Iacono, Lelio Campanile, Andrzej Bargiela (Editors)",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 16:48:37,,102-108,,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,Issue: 1,,,,COVID-19; Discrete event simulation; Healthcare; Sample collection point; SIMUL8; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,1,Simul8,0,,,,,,,,

In line with recent research investigating how simulation-based models and tools could contribute to mitigating the impact of COVID-19, a discrete event simulation model is developed to design optimal saliva-based COVID-19 testing stations performing sensitive, non-invasive, and rapid-result RT-qPCR tests processing. This model aims to determine the adequate number of machines and operators required, as well as their allocation at different workstations, according to the resources available and the rate of samples to be tested per day. The model has been built and experienced using actual data and processes implemented on-campus at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where an average of around 10,000 samples needed to be processed on a daily basis, representing at the end of August 2020 more than 2% of all the COVID-19 tests performed per day in the USA. It helped identify specific bottlenecks and associated areas of improvement in the process to save human resources and time. Practically, the overall approach, including the proposed modular discrete event simulation model, can easily be reused or modified to fit other contexts where local COVID-19 testing stations have to be implemented or optimized. It could notably support on-site managers and decision-makers in dimensioning testing stations by allocating the appropriate type and quantity of resources. Copyright: © 2021 Saidani et al.

We present a cost-effectiveness analysis of ω-3 FA–containing PN vs standard PN in 5 European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK) and the US. Methods: This pharmacoeconomic model was based on estimates of ω-3 efficacy reported in a recent meta-analysis and data from country-specific sources. It utilized a probabilistic discrete event simulation model to compare ω-3 FA–containing PN with standard PN in a population of critically ill and general ward patients. The influence of model parameters was evaluated using probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. Results: Overall costs were reduced with ω-3 FA–containing PN in all 6 countries compared with standard PN, ranging from €1741 (±€1284) in Italy to €5576 (±€4193) in the US. Expenses for infections and HLOS were lower in all countries for ω-3 FA–containing PN vs standard PN, with the largest cost differences for both in the US (infection: €825 ± €4001; HLOS: €4879 ± €1208) and the smallest savings in the UK for infections and in Spain for HLOS (€63 ± €426 and €1636 ± €372, respectively). Conclusion: This cost-effectiveness analysis in 6 countries demonstrates that the superior clinical efficacy of ω-3 FA–containing PN translates into significant decreases in mean treatment cost, rendering it an attractive cost-saving alternative to standard PN across different healthcare systems. © 2020 The Authors.

We assessed the economic impact of propofol TIVA versus inhalational anesthesia in adult patients for ambulatory and inpatient procedures relevant to the US healthcare system. Methods: Two models simulate individual patient pathways through inpatient and ambulatory surgery with propofol TIVA or inhalational anesthesia with economic inputs from studies on adult surgical US patients. Efficacy inputs were obtained from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses assessed the robustness of the model estimates. Results: Lower PONV rate, shorter stay in the post-anesthesia care unit, and reduced need for rescue antiemetics offset the higher costs for anesthetics, analgesics, and muscle relaxants with propofol TIVA and reduced cost by 11.41 ± 10.73 USD per patient in the inpatient model and 11.25 ± 9.81 USD in the ambulatory patient model. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated strong robustness of the results.

Operational challenges such as supply problems and personnel shortages have led to these bottlenecks and inhibited the scale-up of testing to needed levels. This paper uses operational simulations to facilitate rapid scale-up of testing capacity during this public health emergency. Specifically, discrete event simulation models were developed to represent the RT-PCR testing process in a large University of Maryland testing center, which retrofitted high-throughput molecular testing capacity to meet pandemic demands in a partnership with the State of Maryland. The simulation models support analyses that identify process steps which create bottlenecks, and evaluate ""what-if""scenarios for process changes that could expand testing capacity. This enables virtual experimentation to understand the trade-offs associated with different interventions that increase testing capacity, allowing the identification of solutions that have high leverage at a feasible and acceptable cost. For example, using a virucidal collection medium which enables safe discarding of swabs at the point of collection removed a time-consuming ""deswabbing""step (a primary bottleneck in this laboratory) and nearly doubled the testing capacity. The models are also used to estimate the impact of demand variability on laboratory performance and the minimum equipment and personnel required to meet various target capacities, assisting in scale-up for any laboratories following the same process steps.

As the population ages, the consequent demand for various types of medical treatments changes as well, but the process is not uniform, neither for particular age–gender cohorts nor for different diagnoses’ groups. A discrete event simulation (DES) model was built to forecast future healthcare demand based on population projections for one Polish administrative region. Population forecasts, formulated based on simulation experiments carried out in previous studies, were inputted into the DES model, together with patient data taken from the regional health fund. A simulation was run up to 2030 to predict future number of older patients across different diagnosis categories. The results show that a change in the demographic structure and in particular, in the population's ageing, will lead to significant shifts in the distribution of health needs for hospital treatment. © 2021 The Author(s)",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 15:24:24,,,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Hospitals; Discrete-event simulation (DES); Demography; Diagnosis categories; Healthcare demand forecasting; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

The algorithm employs the idea of ordinal optimization，and takes the multi-population genetic algorithm based on affinity evaluation as an iterative optimization strategy.In addition， the improved Optimal Computing Budget Allocation（OCBA）method is used to eliminate the influence of the super individuals，forming a global and adaptive optimal allocation mechanism of simulation resources.

Methods: We calculated costs and quality-adjusted life-years from the UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective. We performed a within-trial analysis using the efficacy, safety, resource use and health utility data from a randomised controlled trial (LEAVO) over 100 weeks. We built a discrete event simulation to model long-term outcomes. We estimated utilities using the Visual-Functioning Questionnaire-Utility Index, EQ-5D and EQ-5D with an additional vision question. We used standard UK costs sources for 2018/19 and a cost of £28 per bevacizumab injection. We discounted costs and quality-adjusted life-years at 3.5% annually. Results: Bevacizumab was the least costly intervention followed by ranibizumab and aflibercept in both the within-trial analysis (bevacizumab: £6292, ranibizumab: £13,014, aflibercept: £14,328) and long-term model (bevacizumab: £18,353, ranibizumab: £30,226, aflibercept: £35,026). Although LEAVO did not demonstrate bevacizumab to be non-inferior for the visual acuity primary outcome, the three interventions generated similar quality-adjusted life-years in both analyses. Bevacizumab was always the most cost-effective intervention at a threshold of £30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, even using the list price of £243 per injection. Conclusions: Wider adoption of bevacizumab for the treatment of macular oedema due to central retinal vein occlusion could result in substantial savings to healthcare systems and deliver similar health-related quality of life. However, patients, funders and ophthalmologists should be fully aware that LEAVO could not demonstrate that bevacizumab is non-inferior to the licensed agents. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 16:34:26,,913-927,,8,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,

Patients and methods: Patient flows, patient pathways and use of hospital resources during the pandemic were simulated using a discrete event simulation model and patient-level data from a large French comprehensive cancer centre's discharge database, considering two scenarios of delays: massive return of patients from November 2020 (early-return) or March 2021 (late-return). Expected additional cancer deaths at 5 years and mortality rate were estimated using individual hazard ratios based on literature. Results: The number of patients requiring hospital care during the simulation period was 13,000. In both scenarios, 6–8% of patients were estimated to present a delay of >2 months. The overall additional cancer deaths at 5 years were estimated at 88 in early-return and 145 in late-return scenario, with increased additional deaths estimated for sarcomas, gynaecological, liver, head and neck, breast cancer and acute leukaemia. This represents a relative additional cancer mortality rate at 5 years of 4.4 and 6.8% for patients expected in year 2020, 0.5 and 1.3% in 2021 and 0.5 and 0.5% in 2022 for each scenario, respectively. Conclusions: Pandemic-related diagnostic and treatment delays in patients with cancer are expected to impact patient survival. In the perspective of recurrent pandemics or alternative events requiring an intensive use of limited hospital resources, patients should be informed not to postpone care, and medical resources for patients with cancer should be sanctuarised. © 2021 The Authors",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 9:55:23,,123-132,,,153,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,COVID-19; Diagnostics; Oncology; Delay; Hospital resources; Survival; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,1,R Simmer,1,,,,,,,,

This study assessed the cost-utility of the fixed dose combination of the bronchodilators tiotropium and olodaterol versus two comparators, tiotropium monotherapy and long-acting β2 agonist/inhaled corticosteroid (LABA/ICS) combinations, in three European countries: Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands. Methods A previously published COPD patient-level discrete event simulation model was updated with most recent evidence to estimate lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs for COPD patients receiving either tiotropium/olodaterol, tiotropium monotherapy or LABA/ICS. Treatment efficacy covered impact on trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1), total and severe exacerbations and pneumonias. The unit costs of medication, maintenance treatment, exacerbations and pneumonias were obtained for each country. The country-specific analyses adhered to the Finnish, Swedish and Dutch pharmacoeconomic guidelines, respectively. Results Treatment with tiotropium/olodaterol gained QALYs ranging from 0.09 (Finland and Sweden) to 0.11 (the Netherlands) versus tiotropium and 0.23 (Finland and Sweden) to 0.28 (the Netherlands) versus LABA/ICS. The Finnish payer's incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of tiotropium/olodaterol was €11 000/QALY versus tiotropium and dominant versus LABA/ICS. The Swedish ICERs were €6200/QALY and dominant, respectively (societal perspective). The Dutch ICERs were €14 400 and €9200, respectively (societal perspective). The probability that tiotropium/olodaterol was cost-effective compared with tiotropium at the country-specific (unofficial) threshold values for the maximum willingness to pay for a QALY was 84% for Finland, 98% for Sweden and 99% for the Netherlands. Compared with LABA/ICS, this probability was 100% for all three countries. Conclusions Based on the simulations, tiotropium/olodaterol is a cost-effective treatment option versus tiotropium or LABA/ICS in all three countries. In both Finland and Sweden, tiotropium/olodaterol is more effective and cost saving (ie, dominant) in comparison with LABA/ICS. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

Emergent questions for each hospital are how many general ward and intensive care unit beds are needed, and additionally, how to optimally allocate these resources during demand surge to effectively save lives. However, hospital pandemic preparedness has been hampered by a lack of sufficiently specific planning guidelines. In this paper, we developed a hybrid computer simulation approach, with a system dynamic model to predict COVID-19 cases and a discrete-event simulation to evaluate hospital bed utilization and subsequently determine bed allocations. Two control policies, the type-dependent admission control policy and the early step-down policy, based on patient risk profiling, were proposed to lower the overall death rate of the patient population in need of intensive care. The model was validated using historical patient census data from the University of Florida Health Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL. The allocation of hospital beds to low-risk and high-risk arrival patients to achieve the goal of reducing the death rate, while helping a maximum number of patients to recover was discussed. This decision support tool is tailored to a given hospital setting of interest and is generalizable to other hospitals to tackle the pandemic planning challenge. © 2021 IEEE.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 9:53:06,,956-961,,,2021-August,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,COVID-19; Hybrid; admission control; hospital pandemic planning; hybrid computer simulation; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,1,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

A new opportunity lies in revising the patient–physician assignment process by limiting the number of patients simultaneously assigned to a single physician, which is defined as the application of a case manager approach with limited caseloads. The potential of introducing a case manager approach with limited caseloads as a way to improve physician productivity, and consequently ED performance, is investigated by use of a discrete-event simulation model based on a real-life case study. In addition, as the case manager system is characterised by three parameters that can be customised and optimised (i.e. caseload limit, pre-assignment queueing discipline and internal queueing discipline), the impact of these parameters on the effectiveness to improve ED performance in terms of length-of-stay and door-to-doctor time is evaluated. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to examine the potential of a case manager system with limited caseloads in a complex service system like a real-life ED, and to investigate the impact of the three system parameters on the results. The outcomes of the study show that performance can be improved significantly by introducing a case manager system, and that the system parameters have an impact on the effect size. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 9:56:21,,783-845,,3,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete-event simulation; Emergency department; Case managers; Healthcare operations; Real-life case study; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

Stochastic programming models were formulated and solved to tackle the stochasticity in the procedure durations and patient arrival patterns. The first model, a two-stage stochastic programming model, is formulated to optimize the slot size. The second model further optimizes the inpatient block (IPB) placement and slot size simultaneously. A computational method is developed to solve the second optimization problem. A case study is conducted using the data from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) centers of Lahey Hospital and Medical Center (LHMC). The current schedule and the schedules obtained from the optimization models are evaluated and compared using simulation based on FlexSim Healthcare. Results indicate that the overall weighted cost can be reduced by 11.6% by optimizing the slot size and can be further reduced by an additional 12.6% by optimizing slot size and IPB placement simultaneously. Three commonly used sequencing rules (IPBEG, OPBEG, and a variant of ALTER rule) were also evaluated. The results showed that when optimization tools are not available, ALTER variant which evenly distributes the IPBs across the day has the best performance. Sensitivity analysis of weights for patient waiting time, machine idle time and exam cancellations further supports the superiority of ALTER variant sequencing rules compared to the other sequencing methods. A Pareto frontier was also developed and presented between patient waiting time and machine idle time to enable medical centers with different priorities to obtain solutions that accurately reflect their respective optimal tradeoffs. An extended optimization model was also developed to incorporate the emergency patient arrivals. The optimal schedules from the extended model show only minor differences compared to those from the original model, thus proving the robustness of the scheduling solutions obtained from our optimal models against the impacts of emergency patient arrivals. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:44:50,,460-481,,3,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete-event simulation; Operations research; Stochastic programming; Appointment scheduling/sequencing; Inpatient exam cancellation; Outpatient scheduling; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

In order to meet the specific care needs of clients, the centre provides a range of services on a booked and walk-in basis, and it is important that clients are seen in a timely manner. To align schedules with client demand, we developed a schedule optimisation model that maximises time nurses spend with clients. This new objective function allows for a simple mixed integer linear programming structure that directly incorporates carryover demand. Client-centred key performance indicators were evaluated using a discrete event simulation model. Optimisation aligns schedules to demand, leading to fewer clients who leave without being seen due to an extended wait. This increases the number of clients receiving care by up to 9 per week, without compromising wait times. Furthermore, our approach addresses service delivery concerns, including baseline nurse coverage for triage and weekly variability in total nurse hours. Strategically aligning nurse shifts to demand is an effective approach to better meet client needs without increasing total nurse staffing levels in a community health centre context. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:26:49,,,,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; Access to care; Health equity; Mixed integer linear programming; Nurse schedule optimisation; Primary health care; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,AnyLogic,0,,,,,,,,

Hospitals endeavour to find sustainable solutions for a variety of challenges ranging from productivity enhancements to resource allocation. For instance, in the UK, evidence suggests that hospitals are struggling due to increased delayed transfers of care, bed-occupancy rates well above the recommended levels of 85% and unmet A&E performance targets. In this paper, we present a hybrid forecasting-simulation-optimisation model for an NHS Foundation Trust in the UK. Using the Hospital Episode Statistics dataset for A&E, outpatient and inpatient services, we estimate the future patient demands for each speciality and model how it behaves with the forecasted activity in the future. Discrete event simulation is used to capture the entire hospital within a simulation environment, where the outputs is used as inputs into a multi-period integer linear programming (MILP) model to predict three vital resource requirements (on a monthly basis over a 1-year period), namely beds, physicians and nurses. We further carry out a sensitivity analysis to establish the robustness of solutions to changes in parameters, such as nurse-to-bed ratio. This type of modelling framework is developed for the first time to better plan the needs of hospitals now and into the future. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 15:16:12,,11673-11690,,17,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Forecasting; Healthcare; Simulation; Optimisation; Mathematical modelling; Multi-period; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Simul8,0,,,,,,,,

The life expectancy of people living with HIV has been prolonged dramatically. Therefore, health systems are now confronted with new challenges, with ever-increasing number of newly diagnosed cases, fuelling the pool of existing patients, with many comorbidities and requiring hospital admissions. Are health systems prepared to handle large and increasing numbers of people with HIV? We developed a HIV-Management Support System (MSS) to support service evaluation and management using simulation by capturing individual patient's pathways within HIV services in the United Kingdom. Two scenarios were tested: (1) the impact of increasing the number of diagnosed cases in steps of 5% on human resources and (2) the impact of treating all patients with ART on hospital admissions. A 5% increase in newly diagnosed HIV cases increases human resource requirements between 4% and 8%, whereas the impact of treating all HIV patients with ART on hospital admissions is far greater. HIV services are under intense pressure and managing patient and service needs are far more important than ever, hence the development of our HIV MSS is timely, to support better planning of services. Note that the HIV simulation model presented in this study is the first of its kind. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 9:52:44,,1847-1860,,5,36,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; HIV; management support system; patient pathway modelling; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,Maybe R - mentions it for analysis of data

Despite this burden, and the promises that prevention could deliver, the implementation and uptake of HIV prevention programmes are still low. The study used the decision support system model to explore the potential impacts of prevention implementation on HIV burden (incidence) and service delivery. Methods: an operational research technique known as discrete event simulation model was used to capture an individual patient´s pathways through the HIV care process from diagnosis to treatment and monitoring. The regular monitoring, over a 5-year period, including all the activities and resources utilized at each stage of the pathway were analysed, and the impact of increasing prevention measures for an HIV treatment service in a treatment centre in Nigeria was tested using the simulation model. Results: forty-three patients currently access the Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) annually, with a 20% and 80% split in the number of patients offered PrEP and PEP, respectively. Scenarios-based on increasing the number of people offered PrEP and PEP from 43 to 250 with a 50/50 split were tested. The outputs revealed improved preventive care by averting new HIV cases, reduction in service demand and utilization, but an increase in the required human resource as well as financial burden. In the next 5 years, the cumulative averted HIV cases are expected to increase from 2 and 5 people (baseline) to 24 and 20 people for PrEP and PEP, respectively. The potentially averted 2 cases per infected persons based on the basic reproductive number of HIV. Conclusion: the effective implementation of PrEP/PEP programme offers an additional safety measure to prevent HIV transmission in at-risk individuals and possibility of ending HIV epidemic. © Adekunle Olatayo Adeoti et al.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 9:55:46,,,,,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Simulation; Patient flow; HIV/AIDS; PrEP/PEP; Prevention; Service utilisation; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,

Patients are part of the physician's panel if they visit the physician somewhat regularly. For the first time, we propose deterministic integer linear programs that decide on the intake of new patients into panels over time, taking into account the future panel development. The main objective is to minimize the deviation between the expected panel workload and the physician's capacity over time. We classify panel patients with respect to age and the number of visits in a period and assume a transition probability from one visit category to another from one period to the next. We can include stationary patient attributes and consider several physicians together. The programs work with aggregation levels for the new patients’ demand concerning the patient attributes. We conduct experiments with parameters based on real-world data. We consider the transition between visit categories and the new patients’ demand to be stochastic in a discrete-event simulation. We define upper bounds on the number of patients in a patient class to be accepted in a period through solving the programs several times with different demand inputs. Even in this uncertain environment, we can significantly reduce the expected differences between workload and capacity over time, taking into account several future periods instead of one. Using a detailed classification of new patients decreases the expected differences further. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:09:07,,391-403,,1,294,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,OR in health services; Access to care; Multi-period; Integer linear programming; Physician panel management; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,AnyLogic,0,,,,,,,,

Methods: The model was developed using patient-level data from the Trans-European Network – Home-Care Management System study. It was coded using RStudio Version 1.3.1093 (version 3.6.2.) and validated along the lines of the Assessment of the Validation Status of Health-Economic decision models tool. The model includes 20 patient and disease characteristics and generates 8 different outcomes. Model outcomes were generated for the base-case analysis and used in the model validation. Results: Patients managed with the early warning system, compared with usual care, experienced an average increase of 2.99 outpatient visits and a decrease of 0.02 hospitalizations per year, with a gain of 0.81 life years (0.45 quality-adjusted life years) and increased average total costs of €11 249. Adding a diagnostic algorithm to the early warning system resulted in a 0.92 life year gain (0.57 quality-adjusted life years) and increased average costs of €9680. These patients experienced a decrease of 0.02 outpatient visits and 0.65 hospitalizations per year, while they avoided being hospitalized 0.93 times. The model showed robustness and validity of generated outcomes when comparing them with other models addressing the same problem and with external data. Conclusions: This study developed and validated a unique patient-level simulation model that can be used for simulating a wide range of outcomes for different patient subgroups and treatment scenarios.

The purpose of this paper is to present the value stream mapping (VSM) of patients at an occupational medicine clinic, proposing a new scenario with the aid of the simulation of discrete events to reduce the total waiting time during the patient's journey. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology consisted of a case study developed in an occupational health clinic, involving the analysis of the patients' arrival times, time of attendance, number of employees and their functions. Data collection considered 100 random samples from the patients' arrival interval and 40 random samples for each of the operational processes performed by the clinic in a work shift. The collected data served as input for the simulation of scenarios and prioritization of the times for the proposal of the future VSM. Findings: With the study it was possible to propose the reduction of time wasted in the patient's journey, mainly the waiting times (37.92%) and the lead time (29.86%), making it possible for the patient to go through the entire process without waiting for queues. In addition, the increase in employee productivity and efficiency in patient care during the work shift is considered. Research limitations/implications: Despite the considerable gains obtained with the realization of this study in relation to the processing times, total waiting time and lead time, the analysis was not considered, the mode of execution of the processes performed by the professionals and the influence of the layout to improve the flow of patients, being some of the challenges for future studies to consolidate lean culture in the health segment. Practical implications: The simulation of discrete events indicated that it is possible to attend a larger number of patients with the same professional structure, in case the delay in the arrival time of doctors and speech therapists is resolved. There was a reduction in the average total waiting time of 37.92%, a reduction in lead time to 29.86% and identification of the steps that most contributed to the increase in queues for patients in a 05:30 min work shift. Originality/value: The work proposed the constitution of a VSM based on a discrete simulation with data from the entire health unit system, considering everything from the reception for patient registration, collection of laboratory and image exams to medical assistance. The work differs from the others in that it considers the patient's entire journey in the occupational medicine clinic, instead of prioritizing only one service department. The analysis of the results considered the scenario that presented the maximum efficiency of the available resources, respecting the patient's individualized care times, which is one of the complaints of the therapeutic teams to the use of standardization by the VSM. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:02:11,,973-991,,5,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Health services; Simulation; Process efficiency; Waste reduction; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

A case study is presented to illustrate how DES could be used by a school’s decision makers to help plan for implementation of an integrated mental health service model. Discrete Event Simulation was used to model the personnel, time, and costs of an integrated mental health service model within a school setting. In addition, costs are calculated and then compared to a business as usual model. Data from the present investigation indicate substantial cost savings of implementing a prevention oriented mental health intervention model within a school setting. In a school of 1000 students, the prevention model could result in an annual cost savings of approximately $30,000 as well as a 50% reduction in disciplinary referrals and 22% reduction in suspensions. Results from the present investigation indicate substantial savings in financial resources and overall numbers of disciplinary infractions when implementing a prevention model. The DES allows for customization of personnel and time to modify the model and resulting output to local conditions. These data may allow school administrators to modify resources to meet student needs. In addition, cost data can help address some of the common implementation barriers associated with adoption of universal screening and preventative mental health services. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 16:57:04,,962-973,,6,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; Prevention; Cost effectiveness; School mental health; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Salabim,1,,,,,,,,No code link.

However, some crucial steps of the chain, for example blood collection, are not adequately studied in the literature. This work analyses the operations in a blood collection centre with the twofold aim of analysing different configurations and evaluating the effectiveness and feasibility of schedules defined at higher planning levels. Materials and methods: The analyses are performed through a discrete event simulation (DES) model that describes a customizable collection centre. Moreover, a feedback loop from the DES to the higher planning level allows to adjust scheduling decisions if they determine criticalities or infeasibilities at the operational level. Results: Numerical tests have been conducted considering a real Italian provider. An experimental plan has been designed to compare different configurations for the blood collection centre and evaluate the best ones in terms of cost and service quality for the three main actors involved (donors, workers and managers). The best configurations have been also used to test the feedback loop.

Health centers should play a pivotal role in rescue operations during severe accidents, especially the emergency department, which normally stands at the frontline of caring for the patients and injured individuals. In this research, the seismic resilience index of an emergency department located in Iran has been investigated as an indicator, representing the post-earthquake level of medical services to the patients. This study, also, identifies the recovery mechanism of the hospital to the normal conditions after the coming earthquake. When it comes to assessing the hospital's seismic resilience index, officials should meet the need of “patient satisfaction” and the best parameter satisfying this need is the waiting time of patients, as a good indicator for the capacity of the hospital in critical circumstances, which is considered in this study as the main measure for the depiction of functionality curve as well. The considered case study is modeled by discrete event simulation in Anylogic software. The results indicate an increase in patient waiting time due to changes in hospital admission rate after the event. Having examined the changes in waiting time and quality of treatment in normal and seismic scenario conditions, the results show that the peak waiting time in the emergency department is equal to 20 h during the seismic scenario. While plotting the functionality curve, it is determined that right after the occurrence of the earthquake, the loss reduction of the emergency department would reach 24% while the value of the seismic resilience index would be approximately 86%. As a final approach, a plan for the promotion of resiliency is proposed by which the waiting time can be reduced up to 35%, enabling decision-makers to have fruitful and proper crisis management when a calamity strikes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:37:57,,,,,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; Waiting time; Emergency department; Functionality curve; Seismic resilience index; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,AnyLogic,0,,,,,,,,

Two modeling requirements are considered for infection simulation: (1) the implementation of social distancing policies and (2) the representation of population movements. To this end, we propose an extended infection model to combine analytical models with discrete event-based simulation models in a hybrid form. Simulation parameters for social distancing policies are identified and embedded in the analytical models. Administrative dis-tricts are modeled as a fundamental simulation agent, which facilitates representing the population movements between the cities. The proposed infection model utilizes real-world data regarding suspected, infected, recovered, and deceased people in South Korea. As an application, we simulate the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. We use real-world data for 160 days, containing meaningful days that begin the distancing policy and adjust the distancing policy to the next stage. We expect that the proposed work plays a principal role in analyzing how social distancing effectively affects virus prevention and provides a simulation environment for the biochemical field. © 2021 by the authors.

Objective: We aimed to effectively triage COVID-19 patients within situations of limited data availability and explore optimal thresholds to minimize mortality rates while maintaining health care system capacity. Methods: A nationwide sample of 5601 patients confirmed with COVID-19 until April 2020 was retrospectively reviewed. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and logistic regression analysis were used to develop prediction models for the maximum clinical severity during hospitalization, classified according to the World Health Organization Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI). The recursive feature elimination technique was used to evaluate the maintenance of model performance when clinical and laboratory variables were eliminated. Using populations based on hypothetical patient influx scenarios, discrete-event simulation was performed to find an optimal threshold within limited resource environments that minimizes mortality rates. Results: The cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the baseline XGBoost model that utilized all 37 variables was 0.965 for OSCI ≥6. Compared to the baseline model's performance, the AUROC of the feature-eliminated model that utilized 17 variables was maintained at 0.963 with statistical insignificance. Optimal thresholds were found to minimize mortality rates in a hypothetical patient influx scenario. The benefit of utilizing an optimal triage threshold was clear, reducing mortality up to 18.1%, compared with the conventional Youden index. Conclusions: Our adaptive triage model and its threshold optimization capability revealed that COVID-19 management can be achieved via the cooperation of both the medical and health care management sectors for maximum treatment efficacy. The model is available online for clinical implementation. © Jeongmin Kim, Hakyung Lim, Jae-Hyeon Ahn, Kyoung Hwa Lee, Kwang Suk Lee, Kyo Chul Koo.

Hemodialysis patients who receive life-sustaining medical therapy in healthcare settings, face unique challenges as they need to be at a dialysis unit three or more times a week, where they are confined to specific settings and tended to by dialysis nurses and staff with physical interaction and in close proximity. Despite the importance and critical situation of the dialysis units, modelling studies of the SARS-CoV-2 spread in these settings are very limited. In this paper, we have used a combination of discrete event and agent-based simulation models, to study the operations of a typical large dialysis unit and generate contact matrices to examine outbreak scenarios. We present the details of the contact matrix generation process and demonstrate how the simulation calculates a micro-scale contact matrix comprising the number and duration of contacts at a micro-scale time step. We have used the contacts matrix in an agent-based model to predict disease transmission under different scenarios. The results show that micro-simulation can be used to estimate contact matrices, which can be used effectively for disease modelling in dialysis and similar settings. Copyright: © 2021 Tofighi et al.

The purpose of this study is to identify opportunities to reduce waiting time using lean techniques and discrete-event simulation (DES). Design/methodology/approach: A five-step procedure is proposed to facilitate the effective utilization of lean and DES to improve the performance of the Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Outpatient Clinic at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi. While lean techniques were applied to reduce the potential sources of waste by aligning processes, a DES model was developed to validate the proposed solutions and plan patient arrivals under dynamic conditions and different scenarios. Findings: Aligning processes resulted in an efficient patient flow reducing both waiting times. DES played a complementary role in verifying lean solutions under dynamic conditions, helping to plan the patient arrivals and striking a balance between the waiting times. The proposed solutions offered flexibility to improve the clinic capacity from the current 176 patients up to 479 (without violating the 30 min waiting time policy) or to reduce the patient waiting time during the visit from the current 33 min to 4.5 min (without violating the capacity goal of 333 patients). Research limitations/implications: Proposing and validating lean solutions require reliable data to be collected from the clinic and such a process could be laborious as data collection require patient and resource tracing without interfering with the regular functions of the clinic. Practical implications: The work enables health-care managers to conveniently conduct a trade-off analysis and choose a suitable inter-arrival time – for every physician – that would satisfy their objectives between resource utilization (clinic capacity) and average patient waiting time. Social implications: Successful implementation of lean requires a supportive and cooperative culture from all stakeholders involved. Originality/value: This study presents an original and detailed application of lean techniques with DES to reduce patient waiting times. The adopted approach in this study could be generalized to other health-care settings with similar objectives. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:48:33,,1260-1288,,6,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete-event simulation; Resource utilization; Lean health care; Outpatient clinics; Patient waiting time; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,

Recovery strategies of paying ransom to the attackers with follow-on restoration and in-house full system restoration from backup are compared. Methods: A multi-unit, patient-based and resource-constrained discrete-event simulation model of a typical U.S. urban tertiary hospital is adapted to model the attack, its impacts, and tested recovery strategies. The model is used to quantify the hospital's resilience to cyberattack. Insights were gleaned from systematically designed numerical experiments. Results: While paying the ransom was found to result in some short-term gains assuming the perpetrators actually provide the decryption key as promised, in the longer term, the results of this study suggest that paying the ransom does not pay off. Rather, paying the ransom, when considered at the end of the event when services are fully restored, precluded significantly more patients from receiving critically needed care. Also noted was a lag in recovery for the intensive care unit as compared with the emergency department. Such a lag must be considered in preparedness plans. Conclusion: Vulnerability to cyberattacks is a major challenge to the healthcare system. This paper provides a methodology for assessing the resilience of a hospital to cyberattacks and analyzing the effects of different response strategies. The model showed that paying the ransom resulted in short-term gains but did not pay off in the longer term. © The Author(s) 2021.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 15:29:52,,,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; healthcare management; resilience; Cyberattack; digital health solutions; hospital emergency services; numerical experiments; ransomware; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,ExtendSim,0,,,,,,,,

This increased health burden is partly due to lower-quality and insufficient maintenance of affordable housing. A movement towards ‘green’ retrofits that improve energy efficiency and increase ventilation in existing affordable housing offers an opportunity to provide cost-effective interventions that can address these health disparities. Methods: We combine indoor air quality modeling with a previously developed discrete event model for pediatric asthma exacerbation to simulate the effects of different types of energy retrofits implemented at an affordable housing site in Boston, MA. Results: Simulation results show that retrofits lead to overall better health outcomes and healthcare cost savings if reduced air exchange due to energy-saving air tightening is compensated by mechanical ventilation. Especially when exposed to indoor tobacco smoke and intensive gas-stove cooking such retrofit would lead to an average annual cost saving of over USD 200, while without mechanical ventilation the same children would have experienced an increase of almost USD 200/year in health care utilization cost. Conclusion: The combination of indoor air quality modeling and discrete event modeling applied in this paper can allow for the inclusion of health impacts in cost-benefit analyses of proposed affordable housing energy retrofits. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:46:34,,,,1,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Pediatric asthma; Discrete event model; Energy retrofit; Indoor air quality; Systems science; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,R,1,,,,,,,,Uses previously built model (by citation).

Randomized controlled trials of EVAR versus OR have shown EVAR is not cost-effective over a patient's lifetime. However, in the EVAR-1 trial, postoperative surveillance may have been sub-optimal, as the importance of sac growth as a predictor of graft failure was overlooked.Methods:Real-world data informed a discrete event simulation model of postoperative outcomes following EVAR. Outcomes observed EVAR-1 were compared with those from 5 alternative postoperative surveillance and re-intervention strategies. Key events, quality-adjusted life years and costs were predicted. The impact of using complication and rupture rates from more recent devices, imaging and re-intervention methods was also explored.Results:Compared with observed EVAR-1 outcomes, modeling full adherence to the EVAR-1 scan protocol reduced abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) deaths by 3% and increased elective re-interventions by 44%. European Society re-intervention guidelines provided the most clinically effective strategy, with an 8% reduction in AAA deaths, but a 52% increase in elective re-interventions. The cheapest and most cost-effective strategy used lifetime annual ultrasound in primary care with confirmatory computed tomography if necessary, and reduced AAA-related deaths by 5%. Using contemporary rates for complications and rupture did not alter these conclusions.Conclusions:All alternative strategies improved clinical benefits compared with the EVAR-1 trial.

Data Sources: We used the national Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) datasets in England, local data and experts from the hospital setting, National Prices and National Tariffs, reports and the literature around the effectiveness of PR programs. Study Design: The COPD pathway was modeled using discrete event simulation (DES) to capture the patient pathway to an adequate level of detail as well as randomness in the real world. DES was further enhanced by the integration of a health economic model to calculate the net benefit and cost of treating COPD patients based on key sets of interventions. Data Collection/Extraction Methods: A total of 150 input parameters and 75 distributions were established to power the model using the HES dataset, outpatient activity data from the hospital and community services, and the literature. Principal Findings: The simulation model showed that increasing referral to PR (by 10%, 20%, or 30%) would be cost-effective (with a benefit-cost ratio of 5.81, 5.95, and 5.91, respectively) by having a positive impact on patient outcomes and operational metrics. Number of deaths, admissions, and bed days decreased (ie, by 3.56 patients, 4.90 admissions, and 137.31 bed days for a 30% increase in PR referrals) as well as quality of life increased (ie, by 5.53 QALY among 1540 patients for the 30% increase). Conclusions: No operational model, either statistical or simulation, has previously been developed to capture the COPD patient pathway within a hospital setting. To date, no model has investigated the impact of PR on COPD services, such as operations, key performance, patient outcomes, and cost-benefit analysis. The study will support policies around extending availability of PR as a major intervention. © Health Research and Educational Trust",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:25:53,,1271-1280,,6,56,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; COPD; decision support toolkit; health economics; cost-benefit analysis; patient flow modelling; pulmonary rehabilitation; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Simul8,0,,,,,,,,

This study aims to apply our established computational model to predict and optimise the performance and resource allocation of ECR services within regional Australia, and applying data from the state of South Australia as a modelling exercise. Method: Local geographic information obtained using the Google Maps application program interface and real-world data was input into the discrete event simulation model we previously developed. The results were obtained after the simulation was run over 5 years. We modelled and compared a single-centre and two-centre ECR service delivery system. Results: Based on the input data, this model was able to simulate the ECR delivery system in the state of South Australia from the moment when emergency services were notified of a potential stroke patient to potential delivery of ECR treatment. In the model, ECR delivery improved using a two-centre system compared to a one-centre system, as the percentage of stroke patients requiring ECR was increased. When 15% of patients required ECR, the proportion of ‘failure to receive ECR’ cases for a single-centre system was 17.35%, compared to 3.71% for a two-centre system. Conclusions: Geolocation and resource utilisation within the ECR delivery system are crucial in optimising service delivery and patient outcome. Under the model assumptions, as the number of stroke cases requiring ECR increased, a two-centre ECR system resulted in increased timely ECR delivery, compared to a single-centre system. This study demonstrated the flexibility and the potential application of our DES model in simulating the stroke service within any location worldwide. © 2021 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 15:27:55,,850-857,,7,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; Google; acute ischaemic stroke; computational model; endovascular treatment; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,SimPy,1,,,,,,,,

The priority of the healthcare system during a crisis is to provide quality care and superior services to the injured people. However, given the usually extreme severity of the crisis that results in a significant number of injured people, proper and timely responsiveness of healthcare systems is a challenging issue This study proposes a novel framework using a hybrid simulation–optimization approach to measure the healthcare responsiveness in crisis to address this real-world problem. This paper closely connects operations research techniques to critical systems thinking notions to evaluate the behavior of a system in the face of crisis. Since all arriving casualties to the hospital are first taken to the emergency department (ED), the ED in a case study is used to illustrate the performance of the presented approach. We designed seven crisis scenarios and one scenario of the ED system in a normal situation and modeled them using discrete-event simulation (DES). Patients’ interarrival times act as the driver of workload experienced in ED during crisis scenarios of varying severity. For crisis simulation scenarios that are unable to cope with the severity of the crisis, we developed an optimization model in an optimization tool to determine the optimal configuration of resources. The optimal configuration can improve healthcare resilience. The results show that an interarrival time of 13.8 min is the maximum threshold, below which feasible solutions could not be found, and the ED system is likely to collapse. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 15:25:50,,,,,31,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Resilience; Crisis; Healthcare responsiveness; Simulation–optimization; Yes,0,1,1,0,STRESS,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,"Uses STRESS, but no code access statement and software not stated."

Methods: A discrete-event simulation model was developed using evidence from published randomized trials. Health outcomes were measured in life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs were included from a public payer perspective in Australian dollars. Outcomes were discounted at 5% over a lifetime horizon. Probabilistic and scenario analyses quantified parameter and structural uncertainty. Results: A total of 60% of patients in the AS arm eventually received radical treatment (surgery or radiotherapy) compared with 90% for RP and 91% for RT. Although AS resulted in fewer treatment-related complications, it led to increased clinical progression (AS 40.7%, RP 17.6%, RT 19.9%) and metastatic disease (AS 13.4%, RP 6.1%, RT 7.0%). QALYs were 10.88 for AS, 11.10 for RP, and 11.13 for RT. Total costs were A$17 912 for AS, A$15 609 for RP, and A$15 118 for RT. At a willingness to pay of A$20 000/QALY, RT had a 61.4% chance of being cost-effective compared to 38.5% for RP and 0.1% for AS. Conclusions: Although AS resulted in fewer and delayed treatment-related complications, it was not found to be a cost-effective strategy for favorable-risk localized prostate cancer over a lifetime horizon because of an increase in the number of patients developing metastatic disease. RT was the dominant strategy yielding higher QALYs at lower cost although differences compared with RP were small. © 2021 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:07:05,,1737-1745,,12,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,simulation; discrete-event simulation; modeling; cost-effectiveness; cost-utility; health economics; active monitoring; active surveillance; localized prostate cancer; radiation therapy; radical prostatectomy; radiotherapy; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,R,1,,,,,,,,

To better treat hemorrhagic shock, hospitals have adopted massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) which accelerate the delivery of blood products to patients. There has been an increase in mass casualty events (MCE) worldwide over the past two decades. These events can overwhelm a responding hospital's supply of blood products. Using a computerized model, this study investigated the ability of US trauma centers (TCs) to meet the blood product requirements of MCEs. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey data of on-hand blood products were collected from 16 US level-1 TCs. A discrete event simulation model of a TC was developed based on historic data of blood product consumption during MCEs. Each hospital's blood bank was evaluated across increasingly more demanding MCEs using modern MTPs to guide resuscitation efforts in massive transfusion (MT) patients. RESULTS: A total of 9,000 simulations were performed on each TC's data. Under the least demanding MCE scenario, the median size MCE in which TCs failed to adequately meet blood product demand was 50 patients (IQR 20-90), considering platelets. Ten TCs exhaust their supply of platelets prior to red blood cells (RBCs) or plasma. Disregarding platelets, five TCs exhausted their supply of O- packed RBCs, six exhausted their AB plasma supply, and five had a mixed exhaustion picture. CONCLUSION: Assuming a TC's ability to treat patients is limited only by their supply of blood products, US level-1 TCs lack the on-hand blood products required to adequately treat patients following a MCE. Use of non-traditional blood products, which have a longer shelf life, may allow TCs to better meet the blood product requirement needs of patients following larger MCEs.

A booking control policy that considers overbooking is then one natural solution. Unlike appointment scheduling problems for clinics and hospitals, in which treating a patient mostly requires only one type of resource, a physical examination set typically requires multiple types of resources. Traditional methods that do not consider set-resource relationship thus may be inapplicable. Methods: We formulate a stochastic mathematical programming model that maximizes the expected net reward, which is the examination revenue minus overage cost. A complete search algorithm and a greedy search algorithm are designed to search for optimal booking limits for all examination sets. To estimate the late cancellation probability for each individual consumer, we apply logistic regression to identify significant factors affecting the probability. After clustering is used to estimate individual probabilities, Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to generate probability distributions for the number of consumers without late cancellations. A discrete-event simulation is performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed solution. Results: We collaborate with a leading physical examination center to collect real data to evaluate our proposed overbooking policies. We show that the proposed overbooking policy may significantly increase the expected net reward. Our simulation results also help us understand the impact of overbooking on the expected number of customers and expected overage. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to demonstrate that the benefit of overbooking is insensitive to the accuracy of cost estimation. A Pareto efficiency analysis gives practitioners suggestions regarding policy determination considering multiple performance indications. Conclusions: Our proposed overbooking policies may greatly enhance the overall performance of a physical examination center. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:33:00,,,,1,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete-event simulation; Healthcare management; Monte Carlo simulation; Late cancellation; Logistic regression; Overbooking; Physical examination; Set-resource relationship; Stochastic mathematical programming; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,Availability of data and materials section - does not mention model.

The current process requires the isolation of testees in the hospitals’ isolation rooms for several hours until the test results are revealed, limiting hospitals’ capacities to test large numbers of cases. The aim of this paper was to estimate the impact of reducing the COVID-19 test time on controlling the pandemic spread, through increasing hospitals’ capacities to test on a mass scale. First, a discrete-event simulation was used to model and simulate the COVID-19 testing process in Morocco. Second, a mathematical model was developed to demonstrate the effect of accurate identification of infected cases on controlling the disease’s spread. Simulation results showed that hospitals’ testing capacities could be increased six times if the test duration fell from 10 hours to 10 minutes. The reduction of test time would increase testing capacities, which help to identify all the infected cases. In contrast, the simulation results indicated that if the infected population is not accurately identified and no precautionary measures are taken, the virus will continue to spread until it reaches the total population. Reducing test time is a vital component of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is essential for the effective implementation of policies to contain the virus. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers..",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:46:12,,,,2,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,COVID-19; Mathematical model; Simulation; Discreteevent simulation; Test time; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,1,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

Each year, preventable medical errors cause hundreds of thousands of deaths in the United States. Many process improvement tools have been applied to the healthcare industry to improve safety and efficiency. However, nearly all of these tools have neglected to explicitly quantify mental workload of healthcare providers despite the consensus that it is related to human performance. This research effort uses the Improved Performance Research Integration Tool (IMPRINT), a discrete-event simulation (DES), to model human performance by quantifying mental workload. This tool has primarily been used to determine manpower and design requirements for military applications. This study takes a unique approach by using IMPRINT to quantitatively model the mental workload demands of healthcare workers. Specifically, this research examines nurses and technicians in an inpatient unit at the Wright-Patterson Medical Center to detect workload differences between staff and identify trends which lead to high workload demands. © 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

Method: The cost-utility study was carried out using a discrete event simulation model representing the natural history of breast cancer. The decision of treatment with chemotherapy based on Oncotype was compared with the standard of treatment based on clinical-pathological criteria. The model included clinical data from Basque hospitals and the literature and was processed by deterministic and probabilistic analysis to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), the cost-effectiveness plane, the acceptability curve and the expected value of perfect information. The study adopted both a health and societal perspective. Results: From a health perspective, the deterministic analysis estimated an ICER for Oncotype of 17,453 euros/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), discount included, and 9,613 euros/QALY without the discount. Eighty five percent (85%) of the simulations were below the efficiency threshold for Spain. The parametric variability associated with the Oncotype results was the main uncertainty factor in the decision. Conclusions: Oncotype is a cost-effective intervention from a health system perspective since each QALY gained costs less than 25,000 euros. From a societal perspective, it is dominant since it provides greater health and is accompanied by cost savings. © 2018 SESPAS",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 14:35:28,,61-68,,1,34,,,Análisis de coste-utilidad probabilístico y valor esperado de la información perfecta para el test multigénico Oncotype: un modelo de simulación de eventos discretos,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; Cost-effectiveness; Acceptability curve; Expected value of perfect information; Genomic test; Oncotype Dx; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

It allows surgeons to gain additional dexterity, improved precision in surgical tasks, enhanced three-dimensional vision of the surgical field, and superior accessibility to the surgical field. Notwithstanding the clinical outcome benefits (such as reduced blood loss and surgical duration, and shorter length-of-stay at a hospital), the cost of performing robot-assisted surgery is significantly high, due to the investments needed for robot acquisition, maintenance, and procurement of surgical accessories. In this study, we address the twin objectives of a hospital where robot-assisted surgery is performed: maximize the clinical outcome benefits and minimize the total cost of robot-assisted surgery. The surgical robot that is the focus of the study is a da Vinci surgical system. The surgical procedure that serves as the context of this study is hysterectomy. We demonstrate the application of an integrated methodological approach—combining empirical analysis involving an on-site, prospective investigation at a hospital and retrospective analysis of archival data from the hospital for robustness checks, analytical modeling, and discrete event simulation—to identify and analyze actionable policies that a hospital can implement. The specific policies we analyze are related to: (a) patient triaging for robot-assisted surgery based on the criticality of disease condition of a patient; (b) the optimal size of surgeon pool to facilitate the development of surgeon experience and learning; and (c) the minimum experience level of a surgeon with a robot needed to be included in the surgeon pool for robot-assisted surgery. The key contributions of this article are in demonstrating the following: First, hospital-level policies can help to realize both the clinical outcome and cost benefits of a surgical robot. Second, the criticality of patient condition is a significant determinant of surgeon learning in robot-assisted surgery. Third, application of the proposed integrated methodological approach can yield nuanced and actionable insights into an operational setting where data availability is limited and generalizability of study insights is a concern, as is the case in this study. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 14:57:26,,227-256,,1-2,66,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,cost of healthcare; hospital policy; hysterectomy; multi-method study; robot-assisted surgery; surgeon learning; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,

The iTEN model was developed to predict the cost and survival benefits of changing aNSCLC treatment patterns from a Canadian healthcare system perspective. This report describes iTEN model development and validation. Materials &amp; methods: A discrete event patient simulation of aNSCLC was developed. A modified Delphi process using Canadian clinical experts informed the development of treatment sequences that included commonly used, Health Canada approved treatments of aNSCLC. Treatment efficacy and the timing of progression and death were estimated from published Kaplan–Meier progression free and overall survival data. Costs (2018 CDN$) included were: drug acquisition and administration, imaging, monitoring, adverse events, physician visits, best supportive care, and end-of-life. Results and conclusion: Clinical validity of the iTEN model was assessed by comparing model survival predictions to published real-world evidence (RWE). Four RWE studies that reported the overall survival of patients treated with a broad sampling of common aNSCLC treatment patterns were used for validation. The validation coefficient of determination was R2 = 0.95, with the model generally producing estimates that were neither optimistic nor conservative. The model estimated that current Canadian practice patterns yield a median survival of almost 13 months, a five-year survival rate of 3% and a life-time per-treated-patient cost of $110,806. Cost and survival estimates are presented and were found to vary by aNSCLC subtype. In conclusion, the iTEN model is a reliable tool for forecasting the impact on cost and survival of new treatments for aNSCLC. © 2019 The Authors",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 13:50:15,,185-194,,,139,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Cost; Non-small cell lung cancer; Overall survival; Treatment algorithm; Treatment sequencing; Yes,0,1,1,0,ISPOR-SMDM,0,Excel,0,,,,,,,,mentions ISPOR in context of validation

The operating theater in particular is a major cost driver for any hospital, and is among the most critical resources in terms of both capacity and patient care. Effective inventory and distribution systems are a prerequisite for realizing efficiency improvements in the internal operating theater supply chain. In this work, discrete-event simulation is used to model part of the internal distribution process in the operating theater at a Belgian Hospital and to identify improvements by focusing on the replenishment process. A logistics performance measurement framework based on Analytic Network Process (ANP), as a popular Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique, is adopted to assess three replenishment scenarios. The best performing scenario is selected using the Internal Logistics Efficiency Performance (ILEP) index as an evaluation basis.

Teleconsultation resource optimization has become a new research topic. Materials and Methods: Given the complex teleconsultation process was difficult to be described by mathematical methods, a queuing simulation model was developed based on the data and teleconsultation empirical flow of Henan Telemedicine Center of China (HTCC) and we used kernel density estimation to solve the problem of arrival rate and service rate of teleconsultation. The data obtained from HTCC included 21,295 teleconsultation records over a 1-year period (February 27, 2016-March 25, 2017). Results: The average waiting time (WT) that primary hospitals requested for teleconsultation was obtained by simulation and compared with empirical average WT to verify this model. We found that Department of Internal Medicine (DIM) WT was the highest and we searched the optimized combination of teleconsultation rooms and DIM experts by sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: The existing resource allocation was not optimal and the hospital managers can improve it to reduce the hospitals' operating costs and the patients' waiting costs. We suggested that the teleconsultation rooms needed at least four and the DIM experts could increase from three to four. © 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 14:33:31,,114-125,,1,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,telehealth; telemedicine; kernel density estimation; queuing simulation system; resource allocation optimization; sensitivity analyses; teleconsultation; Yes,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,Requested Full Text via ResearchGate

We evaluate the cost-utility of eight high-risk BC surveillance strategies for this population, including the Children's Oncology Group guideline of same-day annual mammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) beginning at age 25 years. Methods: A discrete event simulation model was used to simulate the life histories of a cohort of 500 000 25-year-old women treated for HL at age 15 years. We estimated BC incidence and mortality, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), health-care costs, and the relative cost-utility (incremental cost-utility ratio [ICUR]) under the eight assessed surveillance strategies. One-way sensitivity analysis enabled modeling of uncertainty evaluation. A publicly funded health-care payer perspective was adopted. Results: Costs across the eight screening strategies ranged from $32 643 to $43 739, whereas QALYs ranged from 24.419 to 24.480. In an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, annual mammography beginning at age 25 years was associated with an ICUR of $43 000/QALY gained, annual MRI beginning at age 25 years with a switch to annual mammography at age 50 years had an ICUR of $148 000/QALY, and annual MRI beginning at age 25 years had an ICUR of $227 222/QALY. Among all assessed surveillance strategies, the differences in life expectancy were small. Conclusions: Current high-risk BC surveillance guidelines do not reflect the most cost-effective strategy in survivors of adolescent HL. The results suggest that groups at high risk of BC may require high-risk surveillance guidelines that reflect their specific risk profile. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

These approaches help diagnose department specific issues but miss the wider picture and fail to capture the upstream and downstream impacts. This is particularly important in congested hospitals where operational issues in one department will likely have a ripple effect throughout the hospital. This inter-department dependence in congested hospitals is reflected in the surge policies used when congestion reaches a threshold that is deemed to require a whole hospital response. A hospital-wide generic discrete-event simulation (DES) model, that factors in the effects of congestion, has been built to tackle these problems. Insights on the importance of wide model boundaries and surge protocol modelling, gained through application of the model at three hospitals in Ontario, Canada, are shared. Example scenarios used to illustrate this include early discharge planning, and surgical throughput improvement. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 13:38:36,,41-51,,,316,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; Hospital; Patient flow; Surge policy; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Simul8,0,,,,,,,,

The main contribution of this paper is to develop a Discrete Event Simulation model to describe in detail the pathways of complex patients through medical hospital wards. The model has been applied to reproduce a case study of an Italian middle size hospital. The objective is quantifying the impact on resource use and outcome of introducing a new organizational model for medical departments. The re-organization is mainly focused on changing the available beds assignment among the wards to better address the complexity of care of patients with comorbidities. Following a patient-centered approach, patients are segmented considering the clinical characteristics (i.e. the pathology, proxy of Diagnoses Related Groups classification) and sub-grouped considering other characteristics, such as comorbidities and ward of admission. Then, an optimization component embedded into the model chooses the best pooling strategy to reorganize medical wards, determining the corresponding number of beds able to improve process indicators, such as length of stay.

Recent statistics showed that 9% of the United States population was considered to be Limited English Proficiency (LEP). Unlike nurse-to-patient ratio, there are no established standards for interpreter-to-patient ratio. Patient outcomes from the use of interpreters have been investigated and although there are some contradictions in the literature, there is evidence that interpreter services have positive impacts on outcomes, and on patient and provider satisfaction. As Christiana Care Health System works to optimize interpreter staffing and scheduling, we uncover key areas that present challenges and opportunities for improvement. This presentation will focus on areas identified, lessons learned, and our approach to overcome these challenges.

In this paper, a case study is presented in which a discrete event simulation model is utilized to measure the current performance of patients' discharge process at King Abdullah University Hospital in Jordan with the objective of increasing the efficiency of this process. The average discharge time of patients in the units modeled in this study is over 2 hours which needs to be improved. Actual data was collected on patients' inter-arrival times and the time they spend at each sub-process of the discharge process, this data was obtained from the database of the hospital and a conducted time study. Different what-if scenarios that aimed at improving the performance of the discharge process were proposed and tested using the simulation model. Based on the suggested improvements, a 70% reduction in the average patient discharge time was achieved. © 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

It has been argued that DES and SD are complementary approaches and linking two models can enhance capabilities of individual techniques. DES analyzes the system at operational level while SD provides a holistic view of a complex system. The SD model generates the number of beds required daily in the Intensive care unit, the Progressive Bed unit and the Regular Bed unit in a hospital based on the current operating plan including the current constraints. The DES model investigates the impact of different queue management rules based on fast tracking approaches in the triage area of the ED. The number of beds generated by the SD model serves as the resources in the DES model. The average time in system is used as the primary measure of performance. The paper highlights the benefits derived from a SD-DES hybrid model. © 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

The main dilemma this department faces is overcrowding, causing patients to experience long waiting times and to leave without being served. Healthcare managers have to make important decisions concerning capacity planning, of both human and physical resources. In addition, patient arrivals are highly unpredictable; thus, Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is usually used to replicate and analyze the patient flow in an ED. Accordingly, a DES model is presented in this work, described in detail, with emphasis on the development and modelling stage. Data used to drive the simulation is based on a case study reported in literature for a University Hospital in Ireland. Current results indicate that the performance of the ED indeed does not comply with given standards. Such a DES model presented can potentially benefit healthcare managers, providing them with the required data that will assist them to improve the quality of healthcare in the ED. Future work includes implementation of simulation experiments in order to determine the best resource levels and configurations that improve the performance of the ED. © 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

However, studies on holistic patient flow simulation following system approach are limited and/or poorly understood. Several researchers have been investigating single departments such as ambulatory care unit, Intensive Care Unit (ICU), emergency department, surgery department or patients’ interaction with limited resources such as doctor, endoscopy or bed, independently. Hence, this article demonstrates how to achieve system approach in constructing holistic patient flow simulation, while maintaining the balance between the complexity and the simplicity of the model. To this end, system approach, network analysis and discrete event simulation (DES) were employed. The most important departments in the diagnosis and treatment process are identified by analyzing network of hospital departments. Holistic patient flow simulation is constructed using DES following system approach. Case studies are conducted and the results illustrate that healthcare systems must be modeled and investigated as a complex and interconnected system so that the real impact of changes on the entire system or parts of the system could be observed at strategic as well as operational levels. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 13:44:59,,,418,,12140 LNCS,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,Pages: 429 DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50423-6_31,,,,Discrete event simulation; Network analysis; Patient flow simulation; System approach; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,SimPy,1,,,,,,,,

During the first six weeks of the COVID-19 crisis in Spain, we have contacted a large number of hospital and health department managers in the Valencian Community and other regions of Spain. The result is that very few, at least when contact was made and at the time of writing this article, had consulted staff members in the Operations Management area for advice on this situation, and they are quite reluctant to do so. This is in spite of the fact that some medical sources also consider this crisis to be one of resources, not merely a medical crisis. Our opinion is that Operations Management can make a useful and valuable contribution to anticipate and improve the management of scarce resources, even in times of crisis. If those responsible for public health or heads of hospitals do not see this usefulness, then there is a huge gap between research and practice in Operations Management and what is transmitted to the healthcare sector. Our aim is to help reduce this gap. Design/methodology/approach: In the first part of the article, we will justify that this crisis, besides being a medical crisis, is also a crisis in terms of resources. We will briefly review some of the Operations Management tools that we believe are appropriate for managing this crisis. We will focus on those that we will illustrate in the second part of the article as a practical example of the action research protocol (only the action planning phase), in which we are currently involved. Findings: Due to the peculiarities of the COVID-19 epidemic, it is reasonable to think that the evolution and duration of each outbreak, and the way it is dealt with, will be different in each hospital and/or each health department. Anticipating the number of patients who will require care and forecasting the consumption of resources over time is complex, due to the long and variable incubation times and the uncontrolled evolution of the treatments needed by each patient. Furthermore, since the evolution of new patient admissions is not homogeneous, the forecasting of requirements is difficult. Providing real-time support and detecting with a certain degree of anticipation the potential levels of demand for health care will enable hospitals to define what stages of the contingency plan to apply and how to (re)assign the available resources in the most efficient way possible. Research limitations/implications: Hardly any current data are available, not only publicly, but also through public health ministries and managers; those that are available are not very reliable and come from studies with non-representative samples. For this reason, all forecasts must be taken with a note of caution, and in particular, designing review mechanisms every time a new set of updated reliable data becomes available (something that occurs on a weekly basis). Originality/value: In this work, we will show an example of a proposal for the practical application of Operations Management tools. Our proposal may be useful to hospital managers and public administrators in the healthcare sector (regional ministries or their equivalents). Each health department, hospital or hospital group will generate the aggregate data that facilitate the calculation of needs as input parameters for the model (available and occupied beds, daily admissions, mean lengths of stay in each healing phase and the percent of patients who evolve from one stage to another in the progression of the disease/healing process) and will be able to analyze how the system responds and evaluate different strategies or mitigating actions. These tools have been shown to be useful and reliable in manufacturing and service contexts that show a strong seasonal demand (both occasional and recurring) requiring a great deal of resources. We believe these situations are analogous to those faced by hospitals and the healthcare system in an epidemic like COVID-19. With them, we could facilitate the aggregate planning of resources for hospital administrators in order to provide them operational support during the COVID-19 contingency plan. However, the array of useful tools for this crisis is not limited to those that we will illustrate. Our intent is to encourage the Operations Management academic community to demonstrate how they contribute to the service of society in this COVID-19 epidemic, providing knowledge that can be extrapolated to other similar situations in the future that we may be unfortunate enough to experience. © 2020, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

A detailed description of the system and the main pathways followed by patients during their care process are provided. In fact, analyzing the patient flow has served to improve healthcare delivery in this clinic by identifying the sources of delay which are mainly related to inefficient human resources management. Therefore, a list of improvement scenarios is proposed and evaluated using discrete event simulation model. The proposed changes have resulted in a great improvement in terms of minimizing the patient waiting time (WT) and total length of stay (LOS). Furthermore, we proposed a multiple linear regression model that helped us to analyze the relationship between the performance-related factors (WT and LOS) and the influencing variables related to patient flows. Indeed, these models enable managers to plan reorganization of this outpatient clinical and adopt the suitable strategies for each type of pathway. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 13:59:23,,1-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; waiting time; Patient flow; length of stay; multiple linear regression; pathway; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

Particularly, the bottleneck usually happens at front-end departments (e.g., the triage and medical record department) as every patient is firstly required to visit these departments. The problem is mainly caused by ineffective resource management. In order to support decision making in the resource management at front-end departments, this paper proposes a framework using simulation and multi-objective optimization techniques considering both operating cost and patient satisfaction. Methods: To develop the framework, first, the timestamp of patient arrival time at each station was collected at the triage and medical record department of Thammasat University Hospital in Thailand. A patient satisfaction assessment method was used to convert the time spend into a satisfaction score. Then, the simulation model was built from the current situation of the hospital and was applied scenario analyses for the model improvement. The models were verified and validated. The weighted max–min for fuzzy multi-objective optimization was done by minimizing the operating cost and maximizing the patient satisfaction score. The operating costs and patient satisfaction scores from various scenarios were statistically compared. Finally, a decision-making guideline was proposed to support suitable resource management at the front-end departments of the hospital. Result: The three scenarios of the simulation model were built (i.e., a real situation, a one-stop service, and partially shared resources) and ensured to be verified and valid. The optimized results were compared and grouped into three situations which are (1) remain the same satisfaction score but decrease the cost (cost decreased by 2.8%) (2) remain the same satisfaction score but increase the cost (cost increased up to 80%) and (3) decrease the satisfaction score and decrease the cost (satisfaction decreased up to 82% and cost decreased up to 59%). According to the guideline, the situations 1 and 3 were recommended to use in the improvement and the situation 2 was rejected. Conclusion: This research demonstrates the resource management framework for the front-end department of the hospital. The experimental results imply that the framework can be used to support the decision making in resource management and used to reduce the risk of applying a non-improvement model in a real situation. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:55:08,,,,1,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; Multi-objective optimization; Patient satisfaction; Public hospital; Resource management; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,"The data that support the findings of this study are available from

Methods: A discrete event simulation model (Cardiff T2DM) based on the data observed in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial was adapted to the Spanish setting to estimate the costs and health outcomes of treatment with dapagliflozin in patients with T2DM who had or were at risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Macrovascular events (hospitalization for heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, and unstable angina), end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality were modeled according to the survival equations of the DECLARE-TIMI 58 study. Microvascular events (blindness and ulcers) were estimated based on the risk equations of the UK Prospective Diabetes Study. The analysis was conducted from the Spanish National Health System perspective and the time horizon was 30 years. The results were evaluated in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Only direct health costs were included, and a 3% discount rate was applied to costs and health outcomes. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were made to assess the robustness of the results. Results: In the main analysis, dapagliflozin was a dominant therapeutic option compared with placebo, with greater effectiveness (0.08 QALYs) and lower associated total costs per patient (€ -2,921). The univariate sensitivity analysis and the PSA confirmed the robustness of the results. The PSA showed the probability that dapagliflozin was a dominant alternative compared with placebo was 84.2% and that it was cost-effective of 92.1%, under a willingness-to-pay of € 20,000/QALY gained.

Methods: Using the case of the nationwide implementation of WGS into clinical practice in lung cancer in the Dutch healthcare system, we developed a simulation model to show that including service delivery features across the diagnostic pathway can provide essential insight into the affordability and accessibility of care at the systems level. The model was implemented as a hybrid Agent-Based Model and Discrete-Event Simulation model in AnyLogic and included 78 hospital agents, 7 molecular tumor board agents, 1 WGS facility agent, and 5313 patient agents each year in simulation time. Results: The model included patient and provider heterogeneity, including referral patterns, capacity constraints, and diagnostic workflows. Patient preference and adoption by healthcare professionals were also modeled. The model was used to analyze a scenario in which only academic hospitals have implemented WGS. To prevent delays in the diagnostic pathway, the capacity to sequence at least 1600 biopsies yearly should be present. There is a two-fold increase in mean diagnostic pathway duration between no patients referred or all patients referred for further diagnostics. Conclusions: The systems model can complement conventional health economic evaluations to investigate how the organization of the workflow can influence the actual use and impact of WGS. Insufficient capacity to provide WGS and referral patterns can substantially impact the duration of the diagnostic pathway and thus should be considered in the implementation of WGS. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:31:52,,,,1,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Implementation; Diagnostics; Hybrid; Dynamic simulation modeling; Oncology; Whole genome sequencing; Yes,0,1,1,1,None,0,AnyLogic,0,,,,,AnyLogic Cloud,,,https://cloud.anylogic.com/model/6f5c67f2-1423-422a-be35-63f0f664cc77?mode=SETTINGS

In this study, we compare several strategies for scheduling outpatient surgical procedures in the presence of urgent arrivals. First, a simulation optimization approach is used to find heuristic solutions for a surgery scheduling problem with a heterogeneous set of elective and urgent procedures in a multiple operating room setting. Second, a discrete-event simulation model is used to numerically evaluate how different sequencing and allocation policies perform for multiple surgery procedure types.

Simulating disease transmission dynamics during the Hajj season under different conditions can provide some insights for better decision-making.

Methods: We sought to use integrated agent-based modeling and discrete events simulation techniques to capture risky contacts among the pilgrims and assess different scenarios in one of the Hajj major sites, namely Masjid-Al-Haram. Results: The simulation results showed that a plethora of risky contacts may occur during the rituals. Also, as the total number of pilgrims increases at each site, the number of risky contacts increases, and physical distancing measures may be challenging to maintain beyond a certain number of pilgrims in the site.

This shift has challenged oncology clinics to make chemotherapy treatment as widely available as possible while attempting to treat all patients within a fixed period of time. Historical data from a Veterans Affairs chemotherapy clinic in the United States and staff input informed a discrete event simulation model of the clinic. The case study examines the impact of altering the current schedule, where all patients arrive at 8:00 AM, to a schedule that assigns patients to two or three different appointment times based on the expected length of their chemotherapy infusion. The results identify multiple scheduling policies that could be easily implemented with the best solutions reducing both average patient waiting time and average nurse overtime requirements. © Operational Research Society 2020.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 9:56:03,,163-178,,3,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,healthcare; Discrete event simulation (DES); scheduling; chemotherapy; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Excel,0,,,,,,,,

The solution lies in making best use of existing resources (e.g. beds), as additional funding is not available. Increasing demand and capacity shortages are experienced across all specialties and services in hospitals. Modelling at this level of detail is a necessity, as all the services are interconnected, and cannot be assumed to be independent of each other. Our review of the literature revealed two facts; First an entire hospital model is rare, and second, use of multiple OR techniques are applied more frequently in recent years. Hybrid models which combine forecasting, simulation and optimization are becoming more popular. We developed a model that linked each and every service and specialty including A&E, and outpatient and inpatient services, with the aim of, (1) forecasting demand for all the specialties, (2) capturing all the uncertainties of patient pathway within a hospital setting using discrete event simulation, and (3) developing a linear optimization model to estimate the required bed capacity and staff needs of a mid-size hospital in England (using essential outputs from simulation). These results will bring a different perspective to key decision makers with a decision support tool for short and long term strategic planning to make rational and realistic plans, and highlight the benefits of hybrid models. © Operational Research Society 2019.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 15:22:39,,485-500,,3,72,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; Healthcare; decision support system; forecasting; integer linear programming; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,

They represent a step forward in efficiency and service compared with performing all outpatient surgeries in a hospital setting, allowing that capacity to be reserved for patients requiring hospital stays. When new ASCs are brought online, throughput capacity is either unknown, or estimated from construction schematics. Methods: A discrete event simulation was created to simulate the operations of the Seattle Children’s Bellevue ASC, and identify throughput capacity as the number of operating rooms was increased from three to four, while the Post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) remained constant at 14 beds. The model was queried to determine the number of patients who could receive care while minimizing the duration of crowding (occupancy 13 or greater) in the PACU, limiting mean total crowding time to one hour per week. Results: The simulation was validated against current practice, and determined that up to 50 patients per day can be scheduled through four operating rooms, and the resulting mean crowded time in the PACU would be limited to approximately 59 min. Discussion: DES allows hospitals to support strategic decision making through providing predictions of system performance under a variety of loading scenarios. This allows hospital management planners to inform operations with robust analysis and have confidence in the likely outcomes of policy. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 16:46:37,,920-925,,3,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; healthcare management; Ambulatory surgery center; capacity; pediatric surgery; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,MedModel,1,,,,,,,,

This requires dedicated management attention and effective decision-making process. It is of utmost importance for the management to evaluate the effectiveness of the applied strategies in comparison with the proposed strategies for the performance evaluation of resources. The main goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the applied and proposed management strategies for managing resources in a radiology department of private healthcare facilities. Data were collected regarding the service time and arrival rates. A model is constructed on the Arena simulation software to investigate different strategies of management in a private healthcare facility. The study evidenced that the newly applied strategy is more effective compared to the old one, but there is room for improvement in the services provided to treat all patients on the same day upon arrival with no rescheduled patients. The study demonstrated that the proposed strategy will enable the healthcare facility to treat all patients on the same day upon arrival with no rescheduled patients. In addition to that, the study revealed that the management of private healthcare facilities in Saudi Arabia is more efficient and effective compared to the management of the public healthcare facilities.

Due to partial precedence constraints between different modalities, the problem is formulated as a static, multi-stage/multi-server system. We proposed a novel social network analysis (SNA) based approach to examine the relationship between identified modalities and their influence with different examination type. To validate the results of SNA model, in a real time environment a simulation analysis is carried out by using FlexSim Healthcare software. Based on the empirical data collected from the radiology department, comparisons between the present condition of the department and the achieved results from proposed approach is performed through discrete event simulation model.

Efficient allocation of limited healthcare resources requires evaluation not only of clinical safety and efficacy but also economic consequences. The study aim was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of canagliflozin when added to current standard of care (SoC) versus SoC alone from the perspective of the NHS in England. Methods: A microsimulation model was developed using patient-level data from CREDENCE, including risk equations for the key clinical outcomes of start of dialysis, hospitalisation for heart failure, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and all-cause mortality. DKD progression was modelled using estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio evolution equations. Risk for kidney transplant was sourced from UK-specific sources given the near absence of events in CREDENCE. Patient characteristics and treatment effects were sourced from CREDENCE. Unit costs (£2019) and disutility weights were sourced from the literature and discounted at 3.5% annually. The time horizon was 10 years in the base case, and sensitivity analysis was performed. Results: Canagliflozin was associated with sizable gains in life-years and quality-adjusted life-year (QALYs) over 10 years, with gains increasing with simulation duration. Cost offsets associated with reductions in cardiovascular and renal complications were sufficient to achieve overall net cost savings. The findings were generally confirmed in the sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: Model results suggest that adding canagliflozin 100 mg to SoC can improve patient outcomes while reducing overall net costs from the NHS perspective in England.

Rapid mass vaccination while a pandemic is ongoing requires the use of traditional and new temporary vaccination clinics. Use of drive-through has been suggested as one of the possible effective temporary mass vaccinations among other methods. In this study, we present a machine learning model that has been developed based on a big dataset derived from 125K runs of a drive-through mass vaccination simulation tool. The results show that the model is able to reasonably well predict the key outputs of the simulation tool. Therefore, the model has been turned to an online application that can help mass vaccination planners to assess the outcomes of different types of drive-through mass vaccination facilities much faster. © 2020 by the authors.

Materials and methods: A discretely integrated condition event model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treatment with valbenazine and deutetrabenazine in a synthetic cohort of 1,000 patients with TD who were receiving antipsychotic medication to treat an underlying psychiatric disorder. Clinical inputs were derived from relevant clinical trials or from publicly available sources. Patients were assessed over 1 year using ≥50% improvement from baseline in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) total score as the primary definition of response. Response at 1 year using Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) score ≤2 was also assessed. Health outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), life years, proportion responding to treatment at 1 year, and number of psychiatric relapses. Results: Regardless of the definition used for response, patients treated with valbenazine were more likely to have responded to treatment at 1 year, lived longer, and accrued more QALYs than patients who received deutetrabenazine. Using the AIMS response criterion, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $9,951/QALY for valbenazine compared with deutetrabenazine. By comparison, using the CGIC response criterion valbenazine dominated deutetrabenazine with valbenazine-treated patients accumulating more QALYs (3.4 vs 3.3 years) and incurring lower lifetime costs ($252,311 vs $283,208) than deutetrabenazine-treated patients. Limitations: There are no head-to-head trials of valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, so probabilities of response used in the model were calculated based on an indirect treatment comparison of results from individual trials with one drug or the other, using only those metrics reported across trials. Conclusions: In patients with TD, treatment with valbenazine is highly cost-effective compared with deutetrabenazine. © 2021 The Author(s).

In this paper, the authors present a case study on using discrete event simulation (DES) to support decision-making in the field of hospital bed management in the light of demographic changes. The case study was elaborated for one of the Polish district hospitals. A DES model was built to simulate admissions to two hospital wards: paediatric and geriatric. A series of experiments were carried out as based on real data extracted from the hospital database and forecasted demographic trends elaborated by the Central Statistical Office of Poland (CSO). The influence of demographic changes on hospital admissions in the chosen age-gender cohorts was explored, examining different variants of hospital bed availability. The results of the experiments show that demographic trends significantly influence healthcare admission and bed utilisation. The reduction in the number of admissions to the paediatric ward by about 6% results in a change in average bed utilisation from 57.90% to 54.06%.

Typically, a cancer patient will undergo a series of procedures, which we designate as events, during their cancer care. The initial stage of the pathway, from suspected diagnosis to confirmed diagnosis and start of a treatment is called cancer waiting time (CWT). This paper focuses on the modelling and analysis of the CWT. Health boards are under pressure to ensure that the duration of CWT satisfies predefined targets. In this paper, we first create the visual representation of the pathway obtained from real patient data at a given health board, and then compare it with the standardised pathway considered by the board to find and flag a deviation in the execution of the cancer pathway. Next, we devise a discrete event simulation model for the cancer waiting time pathway. The input data is obtained from historical records of patients. The outcomes from this analysis highlight the pathway bottlenecks and transition times which may be used to reveal potential improvements for CWT in the future. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 15:25:21,,,57,,12611 LNCS,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,Pages: 71 DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-70650-0_4,,,,Discrete event simulation; Cancer pathway; Cancer waiting time; Process modelling; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Salabim,1,,,,,,,,

In practice different policies are used to allocate these emergency patients to the operating rooms. These policies are (1) keeping operating rooms empty and available for emergency arrivals; (2) treating emergency patients in elective operating rooms, postponing elective patients; and (3) a mix of these two policies. The use of a specific policy affects performance (e.g., utilization, waiting times, overtime). Currently, these effects are not clear, and there is no agreement on what works ‘best’ for a specific hospital. Using discrete-event simulation, we evaluate the policies for many case characteristics such as hospital size, patient case mix, and fraction of (emergency) patients. We gathered the simulation results in a tool called OR analyzer. This tool is made available online and allows healthcare practitioners to gain insight into the effects of the scheduling policies in settings similar to their specific hospital setting.

In healthcare, the use of telemedicine can provide high-quality services for medical evaluation without location restrictions. Telemedicine can significantly improve service quality, personnel management, and resource utilization in the emergency department, reducing operational budget and problems like overcrowding. This chapter presents a dynamic personnel allocation system to manage a fluctuating number of remote physicians, opposite to traditional management practices. The proposed healthcare paradigm is based on telemedicine-based management, requiring a validation simulation tools Discrete Event Simulation (DES). This smart management system was solved using control theory techniques enhanced with soft-computing algorithms like Genetic and Memetic algorithms. This concept’s potential implementation requires extensive use of concepts like the Internet of Things (IoT), achieving an e-Hospital with a smart management system. This work most significant results were the Emergency Department service quality maximization and reduced operational costs under normal and abnormal conditions. The identified improvements were measured using different key performance indicators, which helped evaluate this proposal’s improvements quantitatively. Consequently, the service quality and personnel wellbeing were improved.

Given the trend for higher acuity levels among the COVID-19 patients and increased infection prevention and control (IPAC) precautions, such as donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE), the demands on front-line healthcare professionals have changed. To understand the changes, discrete event simulation (DES) was used to quantify the effects of varying COVID-19 policies on nurse workload and quality of care. We are testing a standard nurse-patient ratio of 1:5 where we vary the number of COVID-19 positive patients in that mix from 1 to 5. Preliminary modeling results show as nurses were assigned to more COVID-19 positive patients, the workload of nurses increased, and quality of care deteriorated. In comparison to the baseline (pre-pandemic) case, distance walked by simulant-nurse, mental workload, direct care time, missed care, missed care delivery time and care task waiting time, increased by up to 40%, 279%, −27%, 132%, 311% and 44%, respectively.

SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly transmissible and could rapidly spread in residential care homes. Objective: The work undertaken aimed to estimate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of viral detection point-of-care tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 compared with laboratory-based tests in the setting of a hypothetical care home facility for elderly residents. Perspective/setting: The perspective was that of the NHS in 2020. The setting was a hypothetical care home facility for elderly residents. Care homes with en suite rooms and with shared facilities were modelled separately. Methods: A discrete event simulation model was constructed to model individual residents and simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 once it had entered the residential care facility. The numbers of COVID-19-related deaths and critical cases were recorded in addition to the number of days spent in isolation. Thirteen strategies involving different hypothetical SARS-CoV-2 tests were modelled. Recently published desirable and acceptable target product profiles for SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests and for hospital-based SARS-CoV-2 tests were modelled. Scenario analyses modelled early release from isolation based on receipt of a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result and the impact of vaccination. Incremental analyses were undertaken using both incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net monetary benefits. Results: Cost-effectiveness results depended on the proportion of residential care facilities penetrated by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests with desirable target product profiles appear to have high net monetary benefit values. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests with acceptable target product profiles had low net monetary benefit values because of unnecessary isolations. The benefit of allowing early release from isolation depended on whether or not the facility had en suite rooms. The greater the assumed efficacy of vaccination, the lower the net monetary benefit values associated with SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests, when assuming that a vaccine lowers the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Limitations: There is considerable uncertainty in the values for key parameters within the model, although calibration was undertaken in an attempt to mitigate this. Some degree of Monte Carlo sampling error persists because of the timelines of the project. The example care home simulated will also not match those of decision-makers deciding on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of introducing SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests. Given these limitations, the results should be taken as indicative rather than definitive, particularly the cost-effectiveness results when the relative cost per SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test is uncertain. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests have considerable potential for benefit for use in residential care facilities, but whether or not this materialises depends on the diagnostic accuracy and costs of forthcoming SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests. Future work: More accurate results would be obtained when there is more certainty on the diagnostic accuracy of and the reduction in time to test result associated with SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests when used in the context of residential care facilities, the proportion of care home penetrated by SARS-CoV-2 and the levels of immunity once vaccination is administered. These parameters are currently uncertain. © 2021 Stevenson et al.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:18:27,,vi-73,,39,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Yes,0,1,1,0,None,1,Simul8,0,,,,,,,,

In the field of health records management, the storing of electronic health records (EHRs) has been one of the topics of greatest interest to academics, though its implementation using blockchain technology has not been without flaws. Therefore, the objective of this research is to select the blockchain protocol that provides the best performance given the scalability issue in the implementation of a BT-based EHR system in a high-priority healthcare institution (HP–HI). Methods: To achieve this objective, a discrete-event simulation tool and the AHP technique are both combined, to model the selected blockchain protocols and to analyze the output data. Results: Ethereum protocol emerges as the platform with the best overall performance for the HP-HI under consideration. This result is based on a rigorous analysis of three blockchain protocols–Ethereum, Dogecoin and Bitcoin–and five criteria to evaluate the scalability in BT-based EHR systems: sent transactions, received transactions, failed transactions, nodes, and cost. This research is the first practical study to assess the implementation of BT-based EHR systems in the context of the Colombian health system. This research also integrates a general evaluation framework that can be replicated to other similar HCs. Conclusions: In light of the scalability problem studied, Ethereum protocol is consistently the most appropriate blockchain solution for the selected HP-HI. This result is in line with previous research on BT-based EHR systems. The problem-solving integrated approach discussed in this research can also be replicated to other similar HCs to improve their performance against pandemics such as COVID-19. © 2021 The Author(s)",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 15:24:47,,,,,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Healthcare systems; Blockchain; Electronic health records; Healthcare centers; Medical records; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,1,OMNeT++ ,1,,,,,,,,

Therefore, a simulation model is proposed with a mathematical model and the Taguchi method based on the real data obtained from a hospital in this paper. Besides, FMEA is utilised to find the priority of problems and guide improvement teams. Decreasing resource wastes, the number of patients in the queue, waiting time in different departments, increasing value-added time, utilisation of resources, and productivity are considered in a mathematical model. The best improvement scenarios and their effects are defined using the proposed model in this paper.

ED plays a key role in promoting hospitals' goals of enhancing service efficiency. ED is a complex system due to the stochastic behavior of patient arrivals, the unpredictability of the care required by patients, and the department's complex nature. Simulations are effective tools for analyzing and optimizing complex ED operations. Although existing ED simulation models have substantially improved ED performance in terms of ensuring patient satisfaction and effective treatment services, many deficiencies continue to exist in addressing the key challenge in ED, namely, long patient throughput time. The patient throughput time issue is affected by causative factors, such as waiting time, length of stay, and decision-making. This research aims to develop a new simulation model of patient flow for ED (SIM-PFED) to address the reported key challenge of the patient throughput time. SIM-PFED introduces a new process for patient flow in ED on the basis of the newly proposed operational patient flow by combining discrete event simulation and agent-based simulation and applying a multi-attribute decision-making method, namely, the technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution. Experiments were performed on three actual hospital ED datasets to assess the effectiveness of SIM-PFED. Experimental results revealed the superiority of SIM-PFED over other alternative models in reducing patient throughput time in ED by consuming less patient waiting time and having a shorter length of stay. The findings also demonstrated the effectiveness of SIM-PFED in helping ED decision-makers select the best scenarios to be implemented in ED for ensuring minimal throughput time while being cost effective. © 2013 IEEE.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:39:00,,103419-103439,,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,simulation modelling; patient flow; Emergency department; decision making; throughput time; Hybrid; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,AnyLogic,0,,,,,,,,Study did reference experimentation reprting guidelines paper

The implementation of drone delivery services can reduce costs and wait-times for goods. The healthcare industry can take advantage of these benefits as prescription drugs are potentially life-saving. Pharmacies fill hundreds of prescriptions a day, and a drone delivery service can better serve their customers. Drones are not restricted by infrastructure and can bypass city congestion; therefore, providing a quick and cost-effective delivery method for pharmacies. Three different methodologies, Truck-Only, Truck-Tandem, and Drone-Only, are researched to determine the effects of employing a drone integrated delivery service in a pharmacy. Drones are either restricted to the “last-mile” of a delivery or take full responsibility for prescription delivery. Data is gathered from the United Kingdom prescription database and implemented into a discrete-event simulation model. The prescriptions are divided into four equally distributed batches throughout the workday and are delivered at once by the associated vehicles. The primary objective is to minimize the costs of the delivery system while remaining feasible. The results suggest that full adoption of drone technology into a delivery system is the most cost-effective and quickest. However, there are significant hurdles that can hinder such implementation, and ultimately, it is up to a pharmacy manager to decide the best course of action. The employed modeling approach can be utilized by any pharmacy looking to develop a delivery service for their customers. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 15:25:32,,,185,,304,,,,International Series in Operations Research and Management Science,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,Pages: 204 DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-69265-0_7,,,,Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Simio,0,,,,,,,,

To pursue better hospital operations management, lean philosophy has been adopted since the its successful cases in the industry. For this purpose, a statistical analysis was made in the hospital database in order to obtain key performance indicators (KPI), such as Takt Time as well as the arrival patterns per priority. Such statistical data and KPIs were posteriorly used to validate a discrete simulation model that represents the emergency system of a public hospital in Portugal. Therefore, multiple processes were modeled, like the admission, triage and the arrival of patients to the treatment rooms. Finally, it is presented the validation procedure for the simulation model.

A COVID-19 screening and testing facility was created. There was a need for increasing throughput of the facility within the existing space and limited resources. Discrete event simulation was used to address this challenge. Methodology: A cross-sectional interventional study was done from September 2020 to October 2020. Detailed process mapping with all micro-processes was done. Patient arrival patterns and time taken at each step were measured by two independent observers at random intervals over two weeks. The existing system was simulated and a bottleneck was identified. Two possible alternatives to the problem were simulated and evaluated. Results: Scenario 1 showed a maximum throughput of 316. The average milestone times of all the processes after the step of “Preparation of sampling kits” jumped 62%; from 82 to 133 min. Staff state times also showed that staff at this step was stretched and medical lab technicians were underutilized. Scenario 2 simulated the alternative with lesser time spent on sampling kit preparation with a 22.4% increase in throughput, but could have led to impaired quality check. Scenario 3 simulated with increased manpower at the stage of bottleneck with 26.5% increase in throughput and was implemented on-ground. Conclusion: Discrete event simulation helped to identify the bottleneck, simulate possible alternative solutions without disturbing the ongoing work, and finally choose the most suitable intervention to increase throughput, without the need for additional space allocation. It therefore helped to optimally utilize resources and get “more from less.”. © The Author(s) 2021.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:25:40,,,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,COVID-19 testing; Discrete event simulation; health care reengineering; health care simulation; resource optimization; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,1,FlexSim,0,,,,,,,,

This paper develops a case study using data from Greenville Memorial Hospital (GMH) in South Carolina, USA. The case study is focused on the delivery of surgical case carts to operating rooms at GMH via Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). This study proposes a framework that integrates data analysis with system simulation and optimization. The study addresses the following research questions: (1) Redesign of the pathways: Do performance measures, such as travel time and task completion time, improve after a redesign of AGV pathways? (2) Operational fleet sizing: Do performance measures, such as travel time and task completion time, improve when the number of AGVs used daily is controlled by the volume of surgical cases? If this is true, then how many AGVs should be used daily? To address research question (1), we compare two AGV pathway designs via an extensive sensitivity analysis. To address research question (2), we use a simulation-optimization model to evaluate the performance of the system for different fleet sizes. Finally, we conduct a pilot study at GMH to validate the results of our analysis. This study indicates that the proposed solution, which uses a smaller fleet of AGVs than currently used at GMH, leads to significant reductions in congestion and travel times, and increased utilization of AGVs. © 2021 “IISE”.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:43:22,,316-337,,4,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; automated guided vehicles; Material handling in healthcare; simulation-optimization; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

Several policies have been developed by hospitals to ensure that patients are not put at clinical risk during overcrowding. These policies suggest flexing nurses from different duties to the overcrowded section. However, the policies do not indicate the details of when exactly the flexing should be activated. We develop a mathematical model to find the optimum levels of triage and treatment queue lengths after which flexing should be activated. The performance indicators of the department are the waiting time targets and the disturbance due to nurse flexing. Because of the lack of closed-form formulations, we propose simulation optimization to solve the problem. By analyzing the model structure, we develop an efficient search procedure of the discrete solution space. We show the application of the proposed method using the data of a large hospital in the UK under different parameter settings. The results show that hospital management should focus on increasing the number of treatment nurses rather than flexing the nurses, and the queue of the service stream that requires tighter staffing should be controlled by an upper limit. © 2021 University of Cincinnati.

To improve patient survival and other health outcomes, it is crucial to shortening the time between incidence occurrence and EMS arrival. Recently, engagement of Citizen Responders (CRs) in the EMS system, with the use of connective technology solutions, has become a viable approach to augmenting EMS responses, especially in areas difficult to be accessed by professional providers in a timely manner. While many community-based CR programs have been implemented and shown promising results in saving individual lives, it remains unclear how EMS system design and operations should be coordinated with available CR support and how to make adjustments in the EMS system in preparation for the CR program implementation. In this paper, we investigate these issues in the context of real-time ambulance redeployment. Specifically, we explore how existing real-time redeployment strategies can be adjusted in presence of CRs, to further improve patients' survival. The performance of our framework is evaluated via discrete-event simulation. Our computational results confirm the improvement in patients' survival once real-time information of CR locations and availabilities is leveraged into traditional EMS operations. © 2021 IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2021.

This paper develops a dynamic mathematical simulation model for personalized healthcare delivery and managed individual health outcomes. It utilizes a highly novel hetero-functional graph theory, most easily understood as an ontological convergence of model-based systems engineering and network science, along with Petri nets. The dynamics of the model builds upon a recently developed systems architecture for healthcare delivery, which bears several analogies to the architecture of mass-customized production systems. At its essence, the model consists of two synchronized Petri nets; one for the healthcare delivery system and another for individuals' health state evolution. The dynamic model links logistical and medical phenomena using a combination of a deterministic Petri net model for the former and a fuzzy Petri net for the latter. The model is demonstrated on two clinical case studies; acute and chronic. Together, the case studies show that the model applies equally to the care of both acute and chronic conditions, transparently describes health outcomes and links them to the evolution of the healthcare delivery system and its associated costs. © 2013 IEEE.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 15:15:00,,138267-138282,,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete-event modeling; dynamic model; healthcare delivery system; individual health outcomes; personalized care; Petri net; Systems framework; Yes,0,1,0,0,None,0,Uknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,Not DES

This creates a challenge for service providers, who must determine how to simultaneously respond to high-acuity calls that require immediate service as well as low-acuity calls that can wait to receive service and can be treated in place. We create a discrete event simulation model to explore the tradeoffs introduced by low-acuity patients and to evaluate vehicle dispatching policies, including those that use parametric operated non-transport vehicles (NTVs). We construct a case study based on data from Hanover County, Virginia. Using this case study, we evaluate performance measures across different vehicle dispatch policies, vehicle mixes, and volumes of low-acuity calls. We find that even as the arrival rate of low-acuity calls increases, nearly all low-acuity calls can be responded to within two hours without affecting response times for high-acuity calls. We also find that using NTVs can free up transport vehicles for responding to high-acuity calls while maintaining paramedic staffing levels. © 2021 IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2021.

Comprehensive care is necessary to prevent asthma complications due to respiratory infections, air quality degradation and seasonal changes. Patients experience these factors differently given their location and additional social determinants of health (SDOH). Simulation modeling is an effective tool to investigate the consequences of these factors on pediatric patient health and the efficiency of the healthcare delivery system. We have developed an agent-based discrete event simulation model framework, which utilizes asthma control test (ACT) values to represent a patient's asthma condition. Medical professionals can use this to evaluate early intervention strategies intended to mitigate asthma exacerbations, specifically those caused by one or more social determinants. SDOH, environmental conditions, emergency department visits, and prescribed medication are modeled and affect patient ACT scores. The framework is currently undergoing early testing and evaluation. Two case studies are presented: one to validate the fundamental capabilities of the model, and another to demonstrate future applications of the model in examining patient population responses to care strategies. For the first case study, populations of 500 pediatric asthma patients were simulated over 12-month periods. Patient responses to environmental changes reflected those seen in the healthcare literature. The framework can be used to evaluate patient responses (e.g., ACT) to medical treatment plans. Users can edit both patient model parameters and SDOH factors. Additional environmental or care submodels can be integrated to determine the efficacy of these preemptive care strategies for pediatric asthma patients. © 2021 IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2021.

PHCs are the first point of contact for an Indian patient with formal medical care, and offer medical care on an outpatient basis, and limited inpatient and childbirth care. In this context, real-time prediction of the wait time of the arriving patient becomes important in order to determine whether the patient must be diverted to another PHC or not. The problem is studied using a discrete event simulation of medical care operations in two PHCs in India, where labour room service operation at each PHC is approximated as an M/G/1 queueing system and the accuracy of real-time delay predictors impacting the extent of the change in operational outcomes at each PHC is shown. Patient diversion is simulated using actual delays as well as the delay estimates generated by various delay predictors based on the state of the system such as queue-length, elapsed service time, and observed delay histories. The simulation of the diversion process also incorporates travel time between the PHCs. A new delay predictor that incorporates information regarding the system state as well as the service time distribution is also introduced in this paper. The operational outcomes at both PHCs without diversion and with diversion using the above delay predictors are compared and it is demonstrated that more accurate delay predictors lead to more equitable utilization of resources involved in provision of childbirth care across both PHCs. © 2021 IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2021.

CHCs are Indian public hospitals that provide secondary healthcare services including routine and emergency care in surgery, general medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, and dental care. The generic modelling approach can facilitate simulation modelling of individual CHCs and other similar hospitals across India and elsewhere by reconfiguring the CHC simulation models presented here. We demonstrate this approach by developing DESs of three different CHC configurations, using a DES model of an archetype CHC rendering general and specialist outpatient care, inpatient care, and diagnostic services such as X-ray imaging and ultrasound scans. The model was parameterized using both primary data (collected during facility visits) and secondary data (published literature), and also via calibration to known operational parameter estimates obtained from primary and secondary sources. Simulation outcomes largely conform with primary data (e.g., low inpatient bed utilization) and with the experience of field experts; however, comprehensive validation of the models is currently a challenge because of very limited published literature on CHC operations in Indian context. We develop the individual CHC simulation models as part of an ongoing effort to simulate the network of public primary and secondary health infrastructure, consisting of primary health centres, CHCs, and district hospitals. This study can provide proof of concept for practitioners in other low/middle-income countries for the development and use of DESs of their public health infrastructure. © 2021 IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2021.

We present a discrete event simulation (DES) model to study the potential benefits of using MSUs in the southern health care region of Sweden (SHR). We included the activities and actions used in the SHR for stroke patient transportation as events in the DES model, and we generated a synthetic set of stroke patients as input for the simulation model. In a scenario study, we compared two scenarios, including three MSUs each, with the current situation, having only regular ambulances. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to further evaluate the presented DES model. For both MSU scenarios, our simulation results indicate that the average time to treatment is expected to decrease for the whole region and for each municipality of SHR. For example, the average time to treatment in the SHR is reduced from 1.31h in the baseline scenario to 1.20h and 1.23h for the two MSU scenarios. In addition, the share of stroke patients who are expected to receive treatment within one hour is increased by a factor of about 3 for both MSU scenarios. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

BaBSim.Hospital, an open-source tool for capacity planning based on discrete event simulation, was developed over the last year to support doctors, administrations, health authorities, and crisis teams in Germany. To obtain reliable results, 29 simulation parameters such as durations and probabilities must be specified. While reasonable default values were obtained in detailed discussions with medical professionals, the parameters have to be regularly and automatically optimized based on current data. We investigate how a set of parameters that is tailored to the German health system can be transferred to other regions. Therefore, we use data from the UK. Our study demonstrates the flexibility of the discrete event simulation approach. However, transferring the optimal German parameter settings to the UK situation does not work-parameter ranges must be modified. The adaptation has been shown to reduce simulation error by nearly 70%.

One of the most effective activities to contrast its diffusion is the execution of mass testing campaigns to track the virus spread. To design an efficient logistic system for such purpose, it is important to correctly plan the clinic layout and size the medical resources involved in the swab testing campaign, to avoid long patient queues or personnel underutilization. This paper describes the development of an original logistics simulation model to support the planning and design of clinics for the walk-in mass testing campaign against COVID-19 performed by South Tyrol Health Agency in just one weekend in November 2020 which involved more than 350’000 citizens. The developed model represents the targeted physical system considering all the different phase of such healthcare process. Furthermore, the duration of the multiple process phases is statistically distributed according to a large dataset collected during the COVID-19 testing campaign for touristic operators conducted in September and October 2020 in South Tyrol. The simulation model virtually evaluates the swab testing clinics with different parameters to determine the best scenario to be implemented. It concerns the number of medical resources allocated, the necessary clinic spaces and the time spent inside the clinic by each patient. The obtained results suggest that the so-defined configuration is distinguished by an average throughput of 8.8 minutes per patient. This clinic prototype has been replicated and set-up all over South-Tyrol territory to reach the targeted number of tested citizens. Indeed, 362’050 people were effectively tested from 20th to 22nd November 2020 leveraging 184 clinics and about 1400 healthcare co-workers, both medical and non-medical personnel. 3’615 Covid-positive people were detected and the virus transmission index of this Province fell from 1.22 to 0.74 just in the following 2 weeks. © 2021, AIDI - Italian Association of Industrial Operations Professors.

The development of Vida has been an international collaboration involving multidisciplinary teams of academics, government officials (including public health, economics, environmental, and demographic data collection officials), and others from six states: Angola, Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, Mexico, and the United States. These collaborators have been involved with the identification of decision support needs, the surfacing and creation of relevant data products, and the evaluation of prototypes, with the vision of creating an openly available online platform that integrates earth observation instruments (Landsat, VIIRs, Planet Lab's PlanetScope, NASA's Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center, etc.) with in-situ data sources (COVID-19 case data, local demographic data, policy histories, mobile device-based mobility indices, etc.). Vida both visualizes historical data of relevance to decision-makers and simulates possible future scenarios. The modeling techniques used include system dynamics for public health, EO-based change detection and machine learning for environmental analysis, and discrete-event simulation of policy changes and impacts. In addition to the direct object of this collaboration (the development of Vida), collaborators have also benefited from sharing individual COVID-19-related insights with the network and from considering COVID-19 response in a more integrated fashion. This work outlines the Vida Decision Support System concept and the EVDT framework on which it is based. The international team is using Vida to evaluate the outcomes in several large cities regarding COVID cases, environmental changes, economic changes and policy decisions. It provides an overview of the overlapping and diverging needs and data sources of each of the collaborating teams, as well as how each of those teams have contributed to the development of Vida.

The framework supports calibration to a real population as well as various manipulations and data collection processes. The freely available open-source implementation in R embraces efficient data structures, parallel computing, and fast random number generation, hence ensuring reproducibility and scalability. With the framework, it is possible to run daily-level simulations for populations of millions of individuals for decades of simulated time.

This medical practice can be defined by the use of telecommunication means to provide care, health promotion, treatment, information exchange between doctors and researchers, and also for various health research. However, there are still many methodologies that present a large consumption of computational memory as well as slowness in sending medical data. And with that focus, the present research aims to implement discrete event modeling, called CBEDE (Coding of Bits for Entities by Discrete Events) to improve the transmission of medical data by specifying the wide spectrum of health-related themes. The modeling was performed using the MATLAB Simulink environment, where AWGN communication channel models with DQPSK (Differential Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) modulation were developed and analyzed in relation to information consumption medical data in MB (megabytes). The proposal directs a different approach with respect to signal transmission, employing in the discrete domain the effect of discrete entities’ technique in the bit generation step, aiming to increase the information capacity transmission in healthcare systems, showing better memory consumption utilization regards improvement of 95.86%. Since diagnostic health interaction offered by e-health enables digital solutions for faster and better-quality health care, enabling the optimization of healthcare services, generating greater interaction between physician and patient, as well as all agents in system health care, where CBEDE methodology may enable faster and more efficient scheduling of consultations, transmission devices monitoring data from patients, presenting great potential for the transmission of medical data. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 15:16:52,,,49,,73,,,,Studies in Big Data,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,Pages: 70 DOI: 10.1007/978-981-15-4112-4_3,,,,Healthcare; Simulation; CBEDE; Discrete events; Modulation; Precoding; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,MatLab Simulink; MatLab SimEvents,0,,,,,,,,

In addition, a discrete event simulation (DES) could evaluate the effects of every improvement scenario. Consequently, a proposed integrated HFMEA-DES model is presented for quality improvement in a general hospital. Design/methodology/approach: In the proposed model, HFMEA is implemented first. As any risk in the hospital is important and that there are many departments and different related risks, all defined risk factors are evaluated using the risk priority number (RPN) for which related corrective actions are defined based on experts' knowledge. Then, a DES model is designed to determine the effects of selected actions before implementation. Findings: Results show that the proposed model not only supports different steps of HFMEA but also is highly in accordance with the determination of real priorities of the risk factors. It predicts the effects of corrective actions before implementation and helps hospital managers to improve performances. Practical implications: This research is based on a case study in a well-known general hospital in Iran. Originality/value: This study takes the advantages of an integrated HFMEA-DES model in supporting the limitation of HFMEA in a general hospital with a large number of beds and patients.

The waiting times as well as the total throughput time are examples of performance indicators that emergency departments need to improve in order to provide a better service to the community. To achieve improvement of performance, the present paper shows a methodology to assist the design process of an emergency department using simulation techniques. In this study, the emergency department of a hospital located in the northern region of Portugal was considered to test the proposed simulation technique. The emergency department initial state was assessed, in terms of patient flow, as well as the human resources needed at every stage of the service. In order to understand in depth the process that a patient goes through during an emergency episode, a comprehensive study was performed on the hospital database. This allowed the analytical description of an emergency episode, which was further used as an input to the simulation model. After developing the simulation model with the information obtained by the hospital’s database, a validation stage was performed. Finally, in order to achieve an optimized design for the emergency department several variant scenarios were considered and evaluated. This methodology proved to be very useful in determining an optimized operation for complex, and non-linear systems. © 2021 by the authors.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:16:41,,1-25,,2,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; Emergency department; Lean healthcare; Operations management; Simulation model; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Simio,0,,,,,,,,

During the epidemic prevention and control period, the risk of infection caused by the accumulation of drug purchase can be effectively controlled and reduced by restricting the time cycle of drug purchase. This paper focuses on the drug purchase needs of patients with chronic diseases at the early stage of closure and resumption of work in the epidemic prevention and control period and proposes an optimization method for the time cycle of drug purchase according to the scene in the drugstore. First of all, according to the principle of ""no drug purchase across districts"" during the epidemic prevention and control period in Wuhan, the possible service relationship between the drugstore and the community was constructed through a complex network model. Then, based on the order data of Shared bikes, the attenuation law of the drug flow along with the distance was extracted, and on this basis, the distribution mechanism of the drug flow in the community was established among the drugstores providing services for it, so as to determine the customer arrival rate at the pharmacy side and realize the coupling of the spatial distribution characteristics of the community and the pharmacy with the queuing theory model. Additionally, the discrete event simulation method was used to simulate the system state under different time cycles of drug purchase. Finally, based on the simulation results, the optimal time cycle was found by using dichotomy to maximize the consideration of patients' demands for drugs and the utilization rate of drugstores. In our study, we took Wuhan central city as an example. First, the number of patients with various chronic diseases was estimated through conditional probability, and then the optimal drug purchase cycle was obtained by using the above method for 28 days. Under the optimal time cycle, the patient's average waiting time was 8.55 min, close to the optimal duration of waiting, and the vast majority of purchasing medicine needs can be met. Also, drugstores can be fully used (More than 87% of drugstores were busy), and the daily stock quantity of drugstores was not more than 100 (bottle or box), which was within the drugstore's capacity. The methods and conclusions of this paper can be used to guide the purchasing decisions of patients with chronic diseases and the preparation of chronic diseases in drugstores. 2021, Science Press.

We assessed the cost effectiveness of primary care-based case detection strategies for COPD. Methods: A previously validated discrete event simulation model of the general population of COPD patients in Canada was used to assess the cost effectiveness of 16 case detection strategies. In these strategies, eligible patients (based on age, smoking history, or symptoms) received the COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire (CDQ) or screening spirometry, at 3- or 5-year intervals, during routine visits to a primary care physician. Newly diagnosed patients received treatment for smoking cessation and guideline-based inhaler pharmacotherapy. Analyses were conducted over a 20-year time horizon from the healthcare payer perspective. Costs are in 2019 Canadian dollars ($). Key treatment parameters were varied in one-way sensitivity analysis. Results: Compared to no case detection, all 16 case detection scenarios had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) below $50,000/QALY gained. In the most efficient scenario, all patients aged ≥ 40 years received the CDQ at 3-year intervals. This scenario was associated with an incremental cost of $287 and incremental effectiveness of 0.015 QALYs per eligible patient over the 20-year time horizon, resulting in an ICER of $19,632/QALY compared to no case detection. Results were most sensitive to the impact of treatment on the symptoms of newly diagnosed patients. Conclusions: Primary care-based case detection programs for COPD are likely to be cost effective if there is adherence to best-practice recommendations for treatment, which can alleviate symptoms in newly diagnosed patients. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 16:34:06,,203-215,,2,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Yes,0,1,1,1,None,0,R; C++,1,,Github,,,,,,Cites a paper where the model was developed and validated.

However, current testing pathways can be costly and time consuming, and the diagnostic yield low. Genome-wide sequencing, including exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS), can improve diagnosis, but at a higher cost. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of genome-wide sequencing in Ontario, Canada. Methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a discrete event simulation from a public payer perspective. Six strategies involving ES or GS were compared. Outcomes reported were direct medical costs, number of molecular diagnoses, number of positive findings, and number of active treatment changes. Results: If ES was used as a second-tier test (after the current first-tier, chromosomal microarray, fails to provide a diagnosis), it would be less costly and more effective than standard testing (CAN$6357 [95% CI: 6179–6520] vs. CAN$8783 per patient [95% CI: 2309–31,123]). If ES was used after standard testing, it would cost an additional CAN$15,228 to identify the genetic diagnosis for one additional patient compared with standard testing. The results remained robust when parameters and assumptions were varied. Conclusion: ES would likely be cost-saving if used earlier in the diagnostic pathway. © 2020, American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 16:38:21,,451-460,,3,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,cost-effectiveness; developmental disabilities; genome-wide sequencing; multiple congenital anomalies; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,TreeAge,0,,,,,,,,

Methods: A discrete event simulation model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of AAA screening for men aged 65, comparing current surveillance intervals to 6 alternative surveillance interval strategies that lengthened the time between surveillance scans for 1 or more AAA size categories. The model considered clinical events and costs incurred over a 30-year time horizon and the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The model adopted the National Health Service perspective and discounted future costs and benefits at 3.5%. Results: Compared with current practice, alternative surveillance strategies resulted in up to a 4% reduction in the number of elective AAA repairs but with an increase of up to 1.6% in the number of AAA ruptures and AAA-related deaths. Alternative strategies resulted in a small reduction in QALYs compared to current practice but with reduced costs. Two strategies that lengthened surveillance intervals in only very small AAAs (3.0-3.9 cm) provided, at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20 000 per QALY, the highest positive incremental net benefit. There was negligible chance that current practice is the most cost-effective strategy at any threshold below £40 000 per QALY. Conclusions: Lengthening surveillance intervals in the UK Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Programme, especially for small AAA, can marginally reduce the incremental cost per QALY of the program. Nevertheless, whether the cost savings from refining surveillance strategies justifies a change in clinical practice is unclear. © 2020 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 16:57:16,,369-376,,3,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; cost-effectiveness analysis; abdominal aortic aneurysm; decision analytic model screening; microsimulation; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,R,1,,,,,,,,Builds on previous work.

It is the purpose of this method-oriented article to explain the major features of “rule-based discrete event simulation” (rule-based DES), which we developed independently in Germany and Switzerland. Our rule-based DES addresses questions concerning the location and relocation of ambulances, dispatching and routing policies, and EMS interplay with other players in prehospital care. We highlight three typical use cases from a practitioner’s perspective and go into different countries’ peculiarities. We show how research results are applied to EMS and healthcare organizations to simulate and optimize specific regions in Germany and Switzerland with their strong federal structures. The rule-based DES serves as basis for decision support to improve regional emergency services’ efficiency without increasing cost. Finally, all simulation-based methods suggest normative solutions and optimize EMS’ performance within given healthcare system structures. We argue that interactions between EMS, emergency departments, and public healthcare agencies are crucial to further improving effectiveness, efficiency, and quality. © 2021 by the authors.

The most significant artificial variability in patient flow is attributable to dysfunctionally scheduled admissions that can be decreased or eliminated by load smoothing. In this study, we examine the impact of load smoothing of scheduled admissions on patient flow performance metrics of an obstetric unit to provide insights for capacity management. We also investigate the relationship between the impact of load smoothing of scheduled admissions on the patient flow performance metrics of the unit and the volume of unscheduled admissions. In doing so, we develop a detailed discrete-event simulation model of the patient flow of the unit in which patients are categorized into different classes. We compare the results of the simulation model before and after implementing different degrees of load smoothing by considering various ratios of average weekend daily load to average weekday daily load. We determine how different degrees of load smoothing reduce the number of beds required, the average waiting time, and the average probability of delay differently while they have no considerable impact on the average bed occupancy rate. Moreover, considering different volumes of unscheduled admissions, we quantify how the reduction in the average waiting time and the average probability of delay by load smoothing increases when the ratio of unscheduled admissions to scheduled admissions decreases. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 15:26:22,,,,,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete-event simulation; Capacity management; Patient flow; Health Care; Load smoothing; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

To improve patient outcomes, a single cancer pathway was introduced in the NHS. In this study, a Discrete Event Simulation was developed to understand bottlenecks during lung cancer treatment. Methods: This study focused on the lung cancer diagnostic pathways at two Welsh hospitals. Discrete Event Simulation is a computer-based method that has been effectively used in demand and capacity planning. In this study, simulation models were developed for the current and proposed single cancer pathways. The validated models were used to provide Key Performance Indicators. Several “what-if” scenarios were considered for the current and proposed pathways. Results: Under the current diagnostic pathway, the mean time to treatment for a surgery patient was 68 days at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital and 79 days at Prince Charles Hospital. For chemotherapy patients, the mean time to treatment was 52 days at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital and 57 days at Prince Charles Hospital. For radiotherapy patients, the mean time to treatment was 44 days at Royal Glamorgan Hospital and 54 days at Prince Charles Hospital. Ensuring that the patient attends their first outpatient appointment within 7 days and streamlining the diagnostic tests would have the potential to remove approximately 20 days from the current lung cancer pathway resulting in a 20-25% increase of patients receiving treatment within 62 days.

Consequently, an accurate blood-based test would be highly desirable to improve the predictive accuracy. However, the clinical value of a new blood test for diagnosing prostate cancer depends on its sensitivity and specificity, in relation to the selected target population. Objective: The aim of this analysis was to investigate the health-economic value of introducing a new and more accurate diagnostic blood-based test to identify men in need of a biopsy to diagnose prostate cancer. Method: We developed a Discrete Event Simulation Model with outputs including number of biopsies, cancer diagnosis, treatments and prostate cancer deaths. The analysis was performed from a health care perspective. It used epidemiologic data, treatment patterns, and health care costs from the Swedish region Skåne (population of 1.3 million). A 90% sensitivity and specificity of the new test was assumed. Results: Among 31,250 men, age 50–69 years, 16.4% had a PSA between 3.0 and 9.9 µg/L and 28.9% a PSA of 2.0–9.9 µg/L. Testing men with PSA 3.0–9.9 µg/L, as in current clinical practice, decreased the number of biopsies by 3595, detected 61 more cancers, resulting in and two more fatalities and subsequently a loss of 14 QALYs. Cost offsets could justify a test value of SEK 4996. Testing a larger population, PSA 2.0–9.9 µg/L prevented 6 deaths, added 50 QALYs, and could justify a value of the test of SEK 5165, given a value of health of SEK 500,000 per QALY. Conclusion: A new blood-based test for prostate cancer has a significant potential to reduce the number of biopsies needed, resulting in reduced health care costs and improve patient care. © 2020, The Author(s).",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:46:52,,77-88,,1,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,

The credibility of the decisions taken by regional and national authorities often depends on the accuracy of population forecasts. Among the mathematical methods used to study demographic phenomena, system dynamics is well suited to address the dynamic complexity that characterises population changes, and this method offers a proven approach called chronological ageing. The best results are achieved using a variation of the method that assumes the availability of historical data at the same level of aggregation. This level of detail is usually available at the national or regional level; however, when collecting data on smaller regions, there are difficulties in obtaining the necessary information. This study introduces an approach we call ‘hierarchical cohorting’, which could be a solution when empirical data are not as detailed as needed for making credible population projections. We also present a simple and effective algorithm that allows researchers to include population projections when modelling expected future demand for services. We demonstrate the application of this algorithm for forecasting the number of patient visits to a regional healthcare system through a case study; however, the approach can be applied wherever a non-stationary flow of events defines the size and structure of demand for services. Our approach combines two perspectives: the macro-level of system dynamics to study demographic changes and the operational level of discrete simulation to model forecasted demand for hospital inpatient services. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 10:18:07,,,,,74,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,System dynamics; Demand; Combined simulation; Decision support; Population ageing; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Extendsim,0,,,,,,,,

Background: Crowding in emergency departments (EDs) is a widely reported problem leading to increased service times and patients leaving without being seen. Methods: Using ED historical data and expert estimates, we created a discrete-event simulation model. We analyzed the likely impact of initiating care and boarding patients in the hallway (hallway care) instead of the exam rooms and adding a dedicated triage space for patients who arrive by emergency medical services (EMS triage) to decrease hallway congestion. The scenarios were compared in terms of LOS, time spent in exam rooms and hallway spaces, service time, blocked time, and utilization rate. Results: The hallway care scenario resulted in significantly lower LOS and exam room time only for EMS patients but when implemented along with the EMS triage scenario, a significantly lower LOS and exam room time was observed for all patients (EMS and walk-in). The combination of two simulated scenarios resulted in significant improvements in other flow metrics as well. Conclusions: Our findings discourage boarding of admitted patients in ED exam rooms. If space limitations require that admitted patients be placed in ED hallways, designers and planners should consider enabling hallway spaces with features recommended in this article. Alternative locations for boarding should be prioritized in or out of the ED. Our findings also encourage establishing a triage area dedicated to EMS patients in the ED. © The Author(s) 2020.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 9:51:28,,161-177,,2,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete-event simulation; length of stay; boarding; crowding; emergency department design; EMS triage; hallway space; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,MedModel,0,,,,,,,,

Methods: Data from the Additional Findings study were used to develop and validate a discrete event simulation model that represented the pathway of delivering AF. Resource implications were estimated by microcosting the consultations, sample verifications, bioinformatics, curation, and multidisciplinary case review meetings. A proof-of-concept model was used to generate costing, and then the simulation model was varied to assess the impact of an automated analysis pipeline, use of telehealth consultation, full automation with electronic decision support, and prioritizing case review for cases with pathogenic variants. Results: For the proof-of-concept delivery model, the average total cost to report AF was US$430 per patient irrespective of result pathogenicity (95% confidence interval [CI] US$375–US$489). However, the cost of per AF diagnosis was US$4349 (95% CI US$3794–US$4953). Alternative approaches to genetic counseling (telehealth, decision support materials) and to multidisciplinary case review (pathogenic AF cases only) lowered the total per patient cost of AF analysis and reporting by 41–51%. Conclusion: Resources required to provide AF can be reduced substantially by implementing alternative approaches to counseling and multidisciplinary case review. © 2020, American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 16:57:32,,606-613,,4,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Yes,0,1,1,0,ISPOR,0,R Simmer,1,,,,,,,,

In current common practice, an even number of appointments is assigned to each slot and patients with appointment are given a strictly higher priority than walk-in patients. As a result, walk-in patients usually wait longer and incur noticeable dissatisfaction. To improve their satisfaction, we propose an integrated optimization approach for patient-centred outpatient scheduling. This approach aims to allocate appointments in line with the temporal variation of patient walk-ins, and further develop a time-invariant threshold-based prioritization scheme to balance the service priorities between the two types of patients in real time. To substantiate this approach, we develop a prospect theory-based model to quantify each patient's real-time satisfaction. We apply discrete-event simulation-based optimization to maximize the average patient satisfaction over the two types of patients. To verify our integrated optimization approach, we conduct a pilot in the endocrine department of Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital. Our results suggest that our approach substantially decreases the waiting time of walk-in patients without much compromise on the satisfaction of patients who made advance appointment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-11-01 9:57:39,,,,,154,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Application in healthcare system; Customer behaviour; Real-time scheduling; Resource allocation; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,

The aim of present study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of empagliflozin compared to dapagliflozin for the treatment of patients with T2DM and established CVD in Greece. Methods: A published health economic model was used to project clinical and economic outcomes of T2DM patients receiving empagliflozin compared to those receiving dapagliflozin. Individual patient-level discrete-event simulation was conducted to predict time-to-event for CV, renal, and adverse events over patients’ lifetimes. Hazard ratios for dapagliflozin versus empagliflozin on each clinical event was estimated from DECLARE-TIMI 58 and EMPA-REG OUTCOME trials’ data using an indirect treatment comparison. Following a public payer perspective, only direct medical costs related to drug acquisition, fatal/non-fatal diabetes-related complications and adverse events were considered (€2020). Model extrapolated outcomes included life years (LY), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses explored the impact of changes in input data. Results: Over a patient’s lifetime, empagliflozin was associated with longer mean survival (17.23 LY with empagliflozin vs 16.07 LY with dapagliflozin) and reduced rate of CV mortality resulting in 0.48 more QALYs (9.27 vs 8.79), at additional costs of €462. The generated ICER of empagliflozin was €965 per QALY gained. Deterministic sensitivity analysis confirmed empagliflozin’s cost-effective profile. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that the probability of empagliflozin being cost effective over dapagliflozin was 100%, at the defined threshold of €36,000 per QALY gained. Conclusion: Empagliflozin was estimated to be a highly cost-effective treatment option compared to dapagliflozin for the treatment of T2DM patients with established CVD in Greece. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 16:36:45,,371-380,,4,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,Links to paper where model was developed.

Aims We aim to assess whether it is cost-effective to improve adherence to the NICE schizophrenia guideline recommendations, compared with current practice. Method A previously developed whole-disease model for schizophrenia, using the discrete event simulation method, was adapted to assess the cost and health impacts of adherence to the NICE recommendations. Three scenarios to improve adherence to the clinical guidelines were modelled: universal provision of cognitive-behavioural therapy for patients at clinical high risk of psychosis, universal provision of family intervention for patients with first-episode psychosis and prompt provision of clozapine for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The primary outcomes were lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years gained. Results The results suggest full adherence to the guideline recommendations would decrease cost and improve quality-adjusted life-years. Based on the NICE willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000-£30 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, prompt provision of clozapine for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia results in the greatest net monetary benefit, followed by universal provision of cognitive-behavioural therapy for patients at clinical high risk of psychosis, and universal provision of family intervention for patients with first-episode psychosis. Conclusions Our results suggest that adherence to guideline recommendations would decrease cost and improve quality-adjusted life-years. Greater investment is needed to improve guideline adherence and therefore improve patient quality of life and realise potential cost savings. Copyright © The Authors, 2020.

This paper takes the emergency care system in Taiwan as the research context, where first-aid hospitals are ranked to three levels, advanced, intermediate, and general, and, currently, emphasizes on a general emergency responsibility hospital. Having limited capacity and capability, a general emergency responsibility hospital treats minor and moderate injuries, from which the majority of earthquake-induced casualties suffer. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of this group of earthquake-induced non-urgent patients on the performance of a hospital. A patient flow model was built to represent patients’ paths throughout emergency care. Based on the model, discrete event simulation was applied to simulate patients’ trajectories and states of a hospital under four seismic scenarios, where patient visits are 1.4, 1.6, 1.9, and 2.3 times the normal number. A healthcare performance index, Crowdedness Index (CI), is proposed to measure crowdedness on a daily basis, which is defined as the ratio of the average waiting time for treatment to the recommended maximal waiting time. Results of simulations rendered the establishment of empirical equations, describing the relation between the maximum CIs and the patient growth ratios. In the most severe case in this study, the maximum CI exceeds 92 and it takes 10 days to recover from the quality drop. This highlights the problem a general emergency responsibility hospital may encounter if no emergency response measure is implemented. Findings are provided pertaining to the predication of a recovery curve and the alarming level of patient increase, which are supportive information for preparedness planning as well as response measure formulation to improve resilience. © 2021 Lin et al.",2021,2022-10-26 15:47:41,2022-10-31 15:13:15,,,,4 April 2021,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,SimPy,1,,,,,,,,

At the same time, the latter face an ever-growing influx of patients, leading to increasing waiting and flow times and thus patient dissatisfaction as well as overload of physicians and nurses. The deployment of medical documentation assistants, who specialize in and undertake documentation work currently performed by physicians, poses a solution to the problem. The goal of this study is to assess the impact of deploying medical documentation assistants on key performance indicators of a surgical emergency department, i.e. waiting and flow times of patients differentiated according to triage categories, utilization of physicians and time allocation of physicians. Methods: The underlying study has analysed the processes of the surgical emergency department of a major university medical centre and modelled them in a discrete event simulation. Data on patient arrivals as well as processing times in the X-ray department and the laboratory were obtained from the clinical information system, while processing times in the emergency department were recorded using time-motion studies. Though the emergency department currently does not deploy medical documentation assistants, the simulation model includes a variable number of such assistants. Results: The deployment of a medical documentation assistant frees up physician working time and decreases the waiting time and consequently the flow time of patients, in particular for standard and non-urgent patients. Adding additional documentation assistants leads to further improvements, however, with diminishing marginal returns. Under the assumption of medical documentation assistants being 35% more efficient than physicians in undertaking documentation work, one of the three physicians can be replaced in the analysed surgical emergency department with an average of 502 patient arrivals per week. Conclusions: Medical documentation assistants are a viable way of improving the performance of surgical emergency departments. Depending on the goals of the hospital, medical documentation assistants can be used for an array of measures such as decreasing patients' waiting and flow times or increasing physicians' time spent on medical treatment. © 2019 The Author(s).",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 15:27:07,,,,1,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; Waiting time; Medical documentation assistant; Process time; Surgical emergency department; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Anylogic,0,,,,,,Datasets,,

We performed a discrete-event simulation model. Women were categorized in low, intermediate and high-risk of fragility hip fracture through screening based on the FRAX® risk assessment tool score (Spanish version). Low-risk women received lifestyle recommendations whereas the high-risk group was assigned to alendronate treatment. For women at intermediate-risk, treatment decision was based on a recalculated score considering bone mineral density (BMD). The cost-effectiveness analysis tested six scenarios defined by different FRAX® cut-off values assessing the incremental costs per averted fracture in 20 years. Deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed. We included a random sample of 5146 women obtained from a Spanish cohort of women referred for BMD. The most cost-effective intervention had an Incremental Cost-effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of 57,390 € per averted hip fracture and consisted of using the FRAX® score without BMD and treating women with a score higher than 5%. The ICER exceeded the acceptability threshold of 25,000 € in all the scenarios. Sensitivity analysis based on time to fracture, treatment efficacy, adherence to treatment and cost of dependence resulted in ICERs ranging from 39,216 € to 254,400 €. An ICER of 24,970 € was obtained when alendronate cost was reduced to 1.13 € per month.

Individuals from older populations tend to have more than 1 health condition (multimorbidity). Current approaches to produce economic evidence for clinical guidelines using decision-analytic models typically use a single-disease approach, which may not appropriately reflect the competing risks within a population with multimorbidity. This study aims to demonstrate a proof-of-concept method of modeling multiple conditions in a single decision-analytic model to estimate the impact of multimorbidity on the cost-effectiveness of interventions. Methods. Multiple conditions were modeled within a single decision-analytic model by linking multiple single-disease models. Individual discrete event simulation models were developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of preventative interventions for a case study assuming a UK National Health Service perspective. The case study used 3 diseases (heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and osteoporosis) that were combined within a single linked model. The linked model, with and without correlations between diseases incorporated, simulated the general population aged 45 years and older to compare results in terms of lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results. The estimated incremental costs and QALYs for health care interventions differed when 3 diseases were modeled simultaneously (£840; 0.234 QALYs) compared with aggregated results from 3 single-disease models (£408; 0.280QALYs). With correlations between diseases additionally incorporated, both absolute and incremental costs and QALY estimates changed in different directions, suggesting that the inclusion of correlations can alter model results. Discussion. Linking multiple single-disease models provides a methodological option for decision analysts who undertake research on populations with multimorbidity. It also has potential for wider applications in informing decisions on commissioning of health care services and long-term priority setting across diseases and health care programs through providing potentially more accurate estimations of the relative cost-effectiveness of interventions. © The Author(s) 2019.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 15:49:43,,842-856,,7,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; health technology assessment; economic evaluation; chronic diseases; comorbidity; cost-utility analysis; decision-analytic modeling; multimorbidity; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Simul8,0,,,,,,,,Extensive supplementary material.

The Triple Pill versus Usual Care Management for Patients with Mild-to-Moderate Hypertension (TRIUMPH) trial showed a greater reduction in blood pressure in patients using fixed-combination, low-dose, triple-pill antihypertensive therapy (consisting of amlodipine, telmisartan, and chlorthalidone) than in those receiving usual care in Sri Lanka. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the triple-pill strategy. Methods: We did a within-trial (6-month) and modelled (10-year) economic evaluation of the TRIUMPH trial, using the health system perspective. Health-care costs, reported in 2017 US dollars, were determined from trial records and published literature. A discrete-time simulation model was developed, extrapolating trial findings of reduced systolic blood pressure to 10-year health-care costs, cardiovascular disease events, and mortality. The primary outcomes were the proportion of people reaching blood pressure targets (at 6 months from baseline) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted (at 10 years from baseline). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated to estimate the cost per additional participant achieving target blood pressure at 6 months and cost per DALY averted over 10 years. Findings: The triple-pill strategy, compared with usual care, cost an additional US$9·63 (95% CI 5·29 to 13·97) per person in the within-trial analysis and $347·75 (285·55 to 412·54) per person in the modelled analysis. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated at $7·93 (95% CI 6·59 to 11·84) per participant reaching blood pressure targets at 6 months and $2842·79 (−28·67 to 5714·24) per DALY averted over a 10-year period. Interpretation: Compared with usual care, the triple-pill strategy is cost-effective for patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Scaled up investment in the triple pill for hypertension management in Sri Lanka should be supported to address the high population burden of cardiovascular disease.

Methods: The trial has shown a reduction in the risk for cardiovascular (CV) and renal events with empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established CV disease. A cost-effectiveness analysis based on the overall population of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial was reported previously by using a lifetime discrete event simulation model. The same modeling frame was adapted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treatment with empagliflozin added to standard of care (SoC) compared with SoC alone in Japan. The time to relevant clinical events and the hazard ratios were derived from an Asian subpopulation in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. The costs for each event were estimated from a Japanese medical claims database. Direct medical costs, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated from the public health care perspective. Findings: Treatment with empagliflozin was estimated to increase life expectancy by 6.2 years and 2.7 QALYs, whereas total cost increased by 1,115,475 yen compared with treatment with SoC alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 415,849 yen/QALY. In the sensitivity analysis, there was no case that was in excess of the reference value of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in the pilot introduction for price revision in Japan (ie, 5 million yen/QALY). Implications: Based on the Asian subpopulation in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, our results suggest that empagliflozin added to SoC is highly cost-effective compared with SoC alone in Japan. © 2019 The Authors",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 15:00:06,,2021-2040.e11,,10,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,cost-effectiveness analysis; empagliflozin; diabetes; EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial; SGLT2 inhibitor; Yes,0,1,1,0,ISPOR,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,Followed up multiple citations - could not determine simulaiton software.

Both methods are known for their limitations. Discrete-event simulation (DES), an event-driven model in continuous time at the patient level, is a relatively new method in health economic evaluations that addresses some limitations of the common modeling techniques. Specifically, with the advent of personalized medicine, conventional methods for value assessment that are based on population-level measures might not be appropriate. The best treatment would depend on patient characteristics and clinical profiles. Value assessment of health interventions can vary substantially and may lead to different health decision making due to patient heterogeneity. As such, modeling at the patient level is an appropriate approach for value assessment of health interventions. The DES model has several advantages, such as flexibility, ability to reflect patient heterogeneity, increased precision, and better characterization of modeling uncertainty, that may be preferred to decision tree and Markov models. In addition, with increasing health care spending and drug prices, it is important to quantify value of available treatment options for women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO). The purpose of this Viewpoints article was to describe and demonstrate an application of a DES model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the current treatment guidelines for women with PMO. In particular, the DES model indicated that the optimal treatment at the common willingness-to-pay thresholds between $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and $150,000 per QALY was denosumab. Analysis of patient heterogeneity in terms of low, medium, high, and very high risk of fractures resulted in a similar conclusion. Copyright © 2019, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy.

This paper seeks to understand how the influence of resources and monitoring effectiveness affect asset availability and overall cost, and to investigate the conditions under which prognostics-enabled CBM could be superior to classic CBM. Without optimisation, prognostics-enabled CBM provided superior technical benefits; however, with optimisation, overall cost effectiveness was achieved. The proposed model can provide maintenance decision makers implementing CBM with numerical evidence in assessing the benefits, and adoption of prognostics in their operation. . © 2019, © Operational Research Society 2019.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 15:43:18,,254-271,,4,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; prognostics and health management; Availability; condition based maintenance; optimisation; Yes,0,1,0,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,Not health.

Using the trial results, we created a discrete-event simulation model to assess lifetime health economic outcomes in people with Type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Methods: Time-dependent survival regression analysis was performed on data from EMPA-REG OUTCOME for 10 cardiovascular and renal events (e.g. stroke, heart failure hospitalization, macroalbuminuria, cardiovascular mortality) to capture event rates over time, and interaction between events. Model performance was assessed by comparing predicted and observed outcomes at 3 years. Costs in the United Kingdom (UK) and health utilities were obtained from published literature. Outcomes included cumulative event rates, life-years, costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results: The model predicted an 18% relative increase (by 2.1 life-years) in survival for empagliflozin (14.0 life-years) vs. standard of care (11.9 life-years), attributable to direct treatment effect on cardiovascular mortality, and to indirect effect via reductions in other events. Participants treated with empagliflozin may experience improved quality of life (1.0 QALY) and higher costs (£3737/participant), yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £4083/QALY. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these results to changes in input parameters. Conclusions: Based on extrapolation of EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial data using a participant-level simulation model, empagliflozin in addition to standard of care is projected to be highly cost-effective using UK healthcare costs. The impact in other countries will vary due to differences in drug pricing and accrual of other costs. (Clinical Trial Registry No: NCT01131676). © 2019 The Authors.

A simulation model of the disease’s natural history was built with a decision tree and Markov models. The model´s parameters were identified by systematic review and validated by expert consensus. A bottom-up cost analysis to estimate the costs of diagnostic strategies and treatment per case was performed by reviewing 48 clinical records of patients diagnosed with ML. The diagnostic strategies compared were as follows: 1) no diagnosis; 2) parasite culture, biopsy, indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and Montenegro skin test (MST) combined ; 3) parasite culture, biopsy, and IFA combined; 4) PCR-miniexon; and 5) PCR-kDNA. Three scenarios were modeled in patients with ML clinical suspicion, according to ML prevalence scenarios: high, medium and low. Adjusted sensitivity and specificity parameters of a combination of diagnostic tests were estimated with a discrete event simulation (DES) model. For each alternative, the costs and health outcomes were estimated. The time horizon was life expectancy, considering the average age at diagnosis of 31 years. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated per Disability Life Year (DALY) avoided, and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. A threshold of willingness to pay (WTP) of three-time gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc) (US$ 15,795) and a discount rate of 3% was considered. The analysis perspective was the third payer (Health System). All costs were reported in American dollars as of 2015. PCR- kDNA was the cost-effective alternative in clinical suspicion levels: low, medium and high with ICERs of US$ 7,909.39, US$ 5,559.33 and US$ 4,458.92 per DALY avoided, respectively. ML diagnostic tests based on PCR are cost-effective strategies, regardless of the level of clinical suspicion. PCR-kDNA was the most cost-effective strategy in the competitive scenario with the parameters included in the present model. © 2019 Castillo-Rodríguez et al.

Patients who are seeking non-emergency but immediate medical services or consultant may save time and money by approaching online doctors through OMAs instead of visiting them physically in healthcare centers. Additionally, medical doctors quantity contributing to OMAs growth, which can affect patients average waiting time and the queue size in healthcare centers. In this paper, We have developed a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model to study the effects of using OMA on the patients healing time and doctors utilization by comparing it with the same process in healthcare centers. Additionaly, we compared patients average queue size, maximum number of patients in the queue, and total number of healed patients in our study. The results of this simulation showed that the healing process in OMA could serve the same number of patients in ~46% shorter time compared to healthcare centers with ~5.7% less doctors' utilization. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 16:08:57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; Telemedicine; Queuing theory; Modeling; Ehealth; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,MatLab SimEvents,0,,,,,,,,

We now estimate the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of increasing the number of centres from 24 to 30. Methods: We constructed a discrete event simulation (DES) to estimate the effectiveness and lifetime cost-effectiveness (from a payer perspective) using 1 year's incidence of stroke in England. 2000 iterations of the simulation were performed comparing baseline 24 centres to 30. Results: Of 80,800 patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke/year, 21,740 would be affected by the service reconfiguration. The median time to treatment for eligible early presenters (< 270 min since onset) would reduce from 195 (IQR 155-249) to 165 (IQR 105-224) minutes. Our model predicts reconfiguration would mean an additional 33 independent patients (modified Rankin scale [mRS] 0-1) and 30 fewer dependent/dead patients (mRS 3-6) per year. The net addition of 6 centres generates 190 QALYs (95%CI-6 to 399) and results in net savings to the healthcare system of £1,864,000/year (95% CI-1,204,000 to £5,017,000). The estimated budget impact was a saving of £980,000 in year 1 and £7.07 million in years 2 to 5. Conclusion: Changes in acute stroke service configuration will produce clinical and cost benefits when the time taken for patients to receive treatment is reduced. Benefits are highly likely to be cost saving over 5 years before any capital investment above £8 million is required. © 2019 The Author(s).",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 15:33:00,,,,1,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Health economics; Acute stroke; Predictive models; Thrombectomy; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,R,1,,,,,,,,

By analyzing statistical data from 30 replications, it shows that there are differences in characteristics between the Community Health Center and the Primary Clinic, in the bottle-neck location and the performance of the Main Clinic is better than the Community Health Center, with patients flowing time, respectively 2516.23 seconds and 4881.03 seconds. However, after repairs were made in the bottle neck location at the Community Health Center and Main Clinic, the flow time of patients was almost the same, respectively 1787.81 seconds and 1731.25 seconds.

This has led a number of authors to describe a link between admission and discharge behaviours, labelled variously as: ‘bumping’, ‘demand-driven discharge’, ‘premature discharge’ etc. These labels all describe the situation that arises when a patient is discharged to make room for the more acute arriving patient. This link between the admission and discharge behaviours, and other potential occupancy-management behaviours, can create a correlation between the arrival process and LOS distribution. In this paper, we demonstrate the considerable problems that this correlation structure can cause capacity models built on queueing theory, including discrete event simulation (DES) models; and provide a simple and robust solution to this modelling problem. This paper provides an indication of the scope of this problem, by showing that this correlation structure is present in most of the 37 ICUs in Australia. An indication of the size of the problem is provided using one ICU in Australia. By incorrectly assuming that the arrival process and LOS distribution are independent (i.e. that the correlation structure does not exist) for an occupancy DES model, we show that the crucial turn-away rates are markedly inaccurate, whilst the mean occupancy remains unaffected.

Methods: Discrete Event Simulation (DES) was used to systematically manipulate flow and physical design. Three base models were developed and validated using ED and patient specific data. Subsequently, systematic manipulations of flow and internal-waiting areas were performed on other models. Five outcomes of interest were tracked – length of stay (LOS), bed utilization rate, door to provider time, left without being seen rate, and number of movements per patient. Models were compared for statistical significance and effect size using ANOVA, and linear and non-linear regression. Results: The shortest LOS (mean 175.2 min) and highest bed utilization rate (5.02 patients/bed/day) were obtained with flow split by an intake attending physician with two internal-waiting areas. These represented improvements of 54 min and 1.48 patients/bed/day over the control model. Two-way ANOVA demonstrated that both physical design and flow type were statistically significant predictors of all outcomes of interest (p <.0001). Depending on flow type, adding one additional internal-waiting area resulted in decreased LOS (range 10.6–21.8 min), increased bed utilization (range 0.23–0.40 patients/bed/day), decreased D2P (range 1.3–4.8 min), and decreased LWBS (0.66%–2.0%). Conclusion: Based on a DES model with empirical data from a single institution, combining flow split by an intake attending physician and multiple internal-waiting areas resulted in improved ED operational and patient-centered metrics. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 15:14:54,,2186-2193,,12,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; ED operations; Split flow; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

Methods: Descriptive statistical analysis was used to recalculate and compare the scores for NEAT and the NSW ETP using variations in the definitions of their measurement on 32 184 presentations during 2016. A computer simulation using a discrete event model illustrated the effect of the use of ED short stay beds on the ETP scores. Results: Using the timestamp of the intent to discharge a patient, called, ‘ready for departure’ instead of the time of a patient physically leaving the department, resulted in an apparent 6% performance improvement. A local interpretation of the NSW state definition of the ‘transferred’ patient resulted in the ETP for ‘admitted’ patients improving by 16%. The discrete event model demonstrated that without changing patient length of stay, ETP scores can be improved by optimising the time of the admit decision or increasing the number of ED short stay beds. Conclusions: The opportunity of NEAT may be squandered unless gaming of the definitions and use of ED short stay beds is addressed. We argue that the longstanding issue of ‘departure time’ should be defined as ‘physically leaving’ the department, in accordance with the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) definition. Patient occupancy is a real measure of ED resource use and NSW and national recommendations should be adjusted.

To solve this problem, under the scenario-response paradigm and theories on parallel emergency management and discrete event system (DES), the parallel simulation decision-making framework (PSDF), which includes the methods of abstract modeling, simulation operation, decision-making optimization, and parallel control, is proposed for unconventional public health emergency response processes. Furthermore, with the example of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) response process, the evolutionary scenarios that include infected patients and diagnostic processes are transformed into simulation processes. Then, the validity and operability of the DES-PSDF method proposed in this paper are verified by the results of a simulation experiment. The results demonstrated that, in the case of insufficient prior knowledge, effective parallel simulation models can be constructed and improved dynamically by multi-stage parallel controlling. Public health system bottlenecks and relevant effective response solutions can also be obtained by iterative simulation and optimizing decisions. To meet the urgent requirements of emergency response, the DES-PSDF method introduces a new response decision-making concept for unconventional public health emergencies.

This study used discrete-event computer simulation to estimate the effect of limiting the work hours of visiting staff on the medical service volume of 6 surgical specialties in hospitals under the National Health Insurance system. Methods: In-depth interviews and questionnaires were used to collect data on visiting staff's work content, elapsed working time, and scheduling logic. We also analyzed the National Health Insurance claims database to obtain the annual volume of outpatients, examinations, and surgical services and the total elapsed time. Based on these data, we developed a medical service model for the 6 surgical specialties and proposed 3 work-hour limitation models (maximum weekly working hours/maximum hours of continuous work: 80/28, 76/28, and 72/24); the effects of the models on the provision of medical services were compared. Results: Compared with the model currently applied for visiting staff, the model in which work hours were reduced led to decreased outpatient volume and delay in the surgical schedule. It had a greater effect on hospitals with an accreditation level lower than that of regional hospitals. The work-hour limitation model with a maximum of 72 working hours per week and a 24-hour limit on continuous duty had the greatest effect on the provision of medical services. Conclusions: The model and research results established in this study provide the competent authorities with a reference when making decisions regarding the limitation of work hours for visiting staff. © 2019 Chinese Public Health Association of Taiwan.

If front line healthcare services remain insufficient, emergency departments will have to offer non-urgent patients appropriate services. More than half of emergency patients are ambulatory patients and their medical condition is not usually as serious as for patients on stretchers (Thibeault, 2014). This paper is devoted to the analysis of ambulatory patient length of stay in an emergency department of a hospital in the province of Quebec. The average length of stay for ambulatory patients in that hospital is slightly more than 7 hours which exceeds the average 4 hours observed for all emergency departments in Quebec. To identify the factors and their interactions affecting the performance of the hospital emergency, measured by the average length of stay for ambulatory patients, experimental design and discrete-event simulation were used. This research aims at verifying how nurses can contribute to reduce emergency department overcrowding. Our results show that giving more responsibility to nurses (collective prescriptions, review patients) reduce greatly the average patient length of stay with less financial effort than adding new doctors.

Using point-of-care tests (POCTs) at peripheral dispensaries could improve access to testing and timely treatment. However, the effect of providing additional services on nurse workload and client wait times are unknown. We use discrete-event simulation (DES) modelling to understand the effect of providing four point-of-care tests for ANC on nurse utilization and wait times for women seeking maternal and child health (MCH) services. Methods: We collected detailed time-motion data over 20 days from one high volume dispensary in western Kenya during the 8-month implementation period (2014-2015) of the intervention. We constructed a simulation model using empirical arrival distributions, activity durations and client pathways of women seeking MCH services. We removed the intervention from the model to obtain wait times, length-of-stay and nurse utilization rates for the baseline scenario where only HIV testing was offered for ANC. Additionally, we modelled a scenario where nurse consultations were set to have minimum durations for sufficient delivery of all WHO-recommended services. Results: A total of 183 women visited the dispensary for MCH services and 14 of these women received point-of-care testing (POCT). The mean difference in total waiting time was 2 min (95%CI: < 1-4 min, p = 0.026) for MCH women when integrated POCT was given, and 9 min (95%CI: 4-14 min, p < 0.001) when integrated POCT with adequate ANC consult times was given compared to the baseline scenario. Mean length-of-stay increased by 2 min (95%CI: < 1-4 min, p = 0.015) with integrated POCT and by 16 min (95%CI: 10-21 min, p < 0.001) with integrated POCT and adequate consult times compared to the baseline scenario. The two nurses' overall daily utilization in the scenario with sufficient minimum consult durations were 72 and 75%. Conclusion: The intervention had a modest overall impact on wait times and length-of-stay for women seeking MCH services while ensuring pregnant women received essential diagnostic testing. Nurse utilization rates fluctuated among days: nurses experienced spikes in workload on some days but were under-utilized on the majority of days. Overall, our model suggests there was sufficient time to deliver all WHO's required ANC activities and offer integrated testing for ANC first and re-visits with the current number of healthcare staff. Further investigations on improving healthcare worker, availability, performance and quality of care are needed. Delivering four point-of-care tests together for ANC at dispensary level would be a low burden strategy to improve ANC. © 2019 The Author(s).",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 15:44:34,,,,1,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Anaemia; Antenatal care; Discrete-event simulation modelling; HIV; Human resources; Integration; Kenya; Malaria; Point-of-care testing; Syphilis; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Witness,0,,,,,,Datasets available on reasonable request,,

Objective and accurate prediction is necessary to increase the effectiveness of the health system. Each disease is different in nature, but the prediction always starts with the development of a predictive model that takes discrete data sets as input and provides the trigger alarm, i.e. the prediction of the symptomatic crises inside certain prediction horizons, as an output. Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) provide many smart features to address these software and physical processes, since these systems are designed with a set of distributed hardware, software, and network components embedded in physical systems attached to humans. The implementation of these predictive devices relies on sensing, processing, and networking. Recent advances in wireless sensor networks, medical sensors, and cloud computing are making CPS an excellent candidate for these predictive and proactive healthcare applications. Formal Modeling and Simulation (M&S) methods are a promising alternative to deal with design issues of these CPS. M&S provides a cost-effective approach to verify and validate the design and implementation details of complex real-time applications. In this chapter, we show a hardware-in-the-loop model-driven method, based on the Discrete Event Systems Specification (DEVS) to apply CPS system engineering to prevent symptomatic events in chronic diseases. Our approach is based on an incremental substitution of initial DEVS software models with actual hardware devices and software control with the same behavior. Consequently, the complete implementation of the CPS is performed using the same M&S context for the entire design cycle. The methodology is validated against one particular neurological disorder: the migraine. In this case, a CPS is formally designed using the proposed methodology to prevent migraine crises up to 30?minutes ahead of the symptomatic event. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 15:09:01,,223-253,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,DOI: 10.1002/9781119552482.ch9,,,,Chronic diseases; Cyber physical systems; Discrete event systems formalism; Healthcare applications; Predictive modeling; Robust methodology; Symptomatic events; Systems design; Yes,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,Not DES

While decisions concerning the ambulance locations are of a tactical nature and often based on static information (i.e. average demand), ambulance dispatching is a real-time decision that must take into consideration the current state of the system (i.e. busy and idle ambulances) when selecting the ambulance to respond to the incoming emergency call. Although only few works have considered these two decisions jointly, they all conclude that the system's performance can be improved and the fleet management decisions streamlined by doing so. However, one of the challenges of the ALDP lies in the estimation of the ambulance availability, which has been addressed in previous papers by means of queueing approaches. In this paper, we propose a recursive simulation-optimization framework which encompasses a mathematical formulation for the ALDP and a discrete event simulation model that produces both empirical estimations of the ambulance availability and the system's performance. Extensive numerical experiments on a set of realistic instances show the potential of the proposed approach as an effective tool for dealing with EMS decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 11:17:12,,713-725,,2,286,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Busy fraction; Emergency medical services; Joint location and dispatching; OR in health services; Simulation-optimization; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,

In order to analyze some specific processes of an ophthalmology ward of a large Italian hospital, ProM6 framework was implemented, which supports process mining techniques in form of plug-ins; the plug-ins process data, in form of Event Log, in order to extract information about the process. The DES model based on such information was run via a commercial tool, Simul8, which allows building sophisticated process models. A timely algorithm was then deployed to adapt the ProM6 information to the DES model. Following, a conformance analysis was conducted by comparing the original Event Log, and the Simulation tool data, taking into account the main case-related model attributes (routing probabilities profile, time perspective, and resources perspective). The paper aims at developing the line of inquiry for what concerns the deployment of approaches to set forth the link between Process mining and Simulation modeling. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 14:35:46,,,,,104,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; Healthcare; Petri-nets; Process Mining; ProM6; Simul8; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Simul8,0,,,,,,,,

We developed a simulation model that can be used to estimate the long-term health and economic consequences of DKD treatment interventions for patients matching the CREDENCE study population. Methods: The CREDENCE Economic Model of DKD (CREDEM-DKD) was developed using patient-level data from CREDENCE (which recruited patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate 30 to &lt; 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, urinary albumin to creatinine ratio &gt; 300–5000 mg/g, and taking the maximum tolerated dose of a renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitor). Risk prediction equations were fit for start of maintenance dialysis, doubling of serum creatinine, hospitalization for heart failure, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and all-cause mortality. A micro-simulation model was constructed using these risk equations combined with user-definable kidney transplant event risks. Internal validation was performed by loading the model to replicate the CREDENCE study and comparing predictions with trial Kaplan–Meier estimate curves. External validation was performed by loading the model to replicate a subgroup of the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) Program with patient characteristics that would have qualified for inclusion in CREDENCE. Results: Risk prediction equations generally fit well and exhibited good concordance, especially for the placebo arm. In the canagliflozin arm, modest underprediction was observed for myocardial infarction, along with overprediction of dialysis, doubling of serum creatinine, and all-cause mortality. Discrimination was strong (0.85) for the renal outcomes, but weaker for the macrovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality (0.60–0.68). The model performed well in internal and external validation exercises. Conclusion: CREDEM-DKD is an important new tool in the evaluation of treatment interventions in the DKD population.

Patients with cardiovascular disease represent a vulnerable population when suffering from COVID-19. Most hospitals have been facing difficulties in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, and there is a need to minimise patient flow time so that staff health is less endangered, and more patients can be treated. This article shows how to use simulation techniques to prepare hospitals for a virus outbreak. The initial simulation of the current processes of the heart clinic first identified the bottlenecks. It confirmed that the current workflow is not optimal for COVID-19 patients; therefore, to reduce waiting time, three optimisation scenarios are proposed. In the best situation, the discrete-event simulation of the second scenario led to a 62.3% reduction in patient waiting time. This is one of the few studies that show how hospitals can use workflow modelling using timed coloured Petri nets to manage healthcare systems in practice. This technique would be valuable in these challenging times as the health of staff, and other patients are at risk from the nosocomial transmission. © 2020 by the authors.

Empagliflozin has been shown to markedly reduce cardiovascular (CV) deaths and HF hospitalizations (HHF) in HF patients with T2D. This study evaluated the lifetime cost-effectiveness of supplementing standard of care (SoC) with empagliflozin, relative to SoC alone, in HF patients with T2D from the UK payer perspective. Methods and results: An existing discrete-event simulation model was adapted for the economic evaluation. Risk equations developed from time-dependent parametric survival analyses using patient-level HF subpopulation data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial were employed to predict CV and renal events. Non-CV death, utility weights, and costs were drawn from UK sources. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Relative to SoC, empagliflozin with SoC yielded fewer first HHF, recurrent HHF, CV death, and non-fatal myocardial infarction but more non-fatal stroke events. Empagliflozin with SoC vs. SoC alone was associated with increased average life expectancy (10.80 vs. 9.59 LYs) and quality of life (6.27 vs. 5.62 QALYs), though at higher lifetime cost (£18 197 vs. £16 829) per person, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £2093 per QALY. The probability of empagliflozin being cost-effective in the HF subpopulation at a £20 000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold was 91%. Conclusions: This analysis suggests that adding empagliflozin to SoC in HF patients with T2D constitutes a cost-effective use of UK healthcare resources and may provide long-term health benefits to patients. © 2020 Boehringer Ingelheim.

One way to improve the quality and quantity of services in health centers is to solve the patient flow problem. Disrupting the normal patient flow, increasing waiting time, reducing productivity and increasing patient dissatisfaction are only some of patient flow problems. Methods: In this research, we first reviewed the relevant literature. Then, we investigated the patient flow problem in an eye hospital. In order to evaluate the solutions, a computerized model was made and validated. The improvement scenarios were divided into policy changes and resource changes. The policy changes scenario was divided into two groups: changing scheduling rules and separating the reception and surgical wards' scheduling. In the first group, we just implemented a scheduling rule for patients’ arrivals. However, in the second group, we proposed a novel idea for implementing scheduling rules for the reception and surgical ward. The main contribution of this research includes: 1) proposing a novel scheduling rule for this problem, 2) proposing a new methodology for comparing scenarios through the simulation model and statistical tool, and 3) proposing a valuable managerial insight toward the patient flow problem through an analytic approach. Results: In the first group of scenarios, the proposed scheduling rule reduced the length of stay (LOS) by 12% and the duration of arrival until dispatch to surgery's ward (DASW) by 35%. In the second group of scenarios, the proposed scheduling rule reduced the LOS by 20% and DASW by 35%. Then, adding one staff member to the eye scan ward and one employee to the laboratory were investigated as two resource enhancement scenarios. Conclusions: The simulations showed that policy change scenarios reduced the LOS and DASW much more than what we can achieve in resource enhancement scenarios. This is a very important managerial insight because it shows that the utilization of resources in an efficient way enhances the healthcare system's efficacy more than increasing the number of resources can do. © 2020",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 11:23:08,,,,,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete Event Simulation; Patient flow problem; PHACO surgery; scheduling rule; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

As we want to minimize response times by changing ambulances allocations, we develop a hybrid algorithm based on a genetic algorithm, with randomized ambulances configurations as population individuals. Also, we embed into the genetic algorithm discrete event simulations to model the reporting, assignment, travel, and attendance processes. We later find that the algorithm optimizes the response times for simulated events, even though these times don't yet compare to response times found in real data. So, we need to evaluate any improvement in real response times. As a study case, we use data from 2014 to 2017 provided by the health authority of Bogotá, Colombia, that contains real values of emergency medical incidents, and the quantity and type of ambulances that attended such incidents. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 11:11:34,,,,,1702,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,Issue: 1,,,,Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,

Method: A discrete event simulation was used to explore the impact of different permutations of staff roster, including the number of shifts per day, the number of staff on duty per shift, overall number of staff accessible to work in the laboratory (i.e. overall staff pool), the frequency of shift changes (i.e. number of consecutive days worked), fixed work-rest days and split team arrangement on workplace transmission of COVID-19 by a simulated index staff who acquired the infection from the community over 21 days. Additionally, the impact of workplace social distancing (physical distancing) and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were investigated. Results: A higher rate of transmission was associated with smaller overall staff pool (expressed as multiples of the number of staff per shift), higher number of shifts per day, higher number of staff per shift, and longer consecutive days worked. Having fixed work-rest arrangement did not significantly reduce the transmission rate unless the workplace outbreak was prolonged. Social distancing and PPE use significantly reduced the transmission rate. Conclusion: Laboratories should consider organizing the staff into smaller teams/shift and reduce the number of consecutive days worked. Additionally, our observation aligns with the IFCC biosafety recommendation of monitoring staff health (to detect early infection), split team arrangement, workplace social distancing and use of PPE. © 2020 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 14:52:14,,15-22,,,86,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,COVID-19; Biosafety; Laboratory management; Nosocomial infection; Social distancing; Staff roster; Yes,0,1,1,1,None,1,Python,1,,,Word doc,,,,,Python code pasted into a word document

The objective of this study was to assess the cost-utility of Souvenaid compared to placebo in patients with prodromal AD under the conditions applied in that trial. Methods: A discrete event simulation model was developed based on the LipiDiDiet trial and a literature review to assess the cost-utility of Souvenaid from a societal perspective considering direct and indirect costs. For both intervention and control groups, patient trajectories in terms of functional decline on the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scale in LipiDiDiet were reproduced statistically with mixed models by assigning time until events to simulated patients. From the societal perspective, four scenarios were analysed by combining different options for treatment duration and diagnostic test cost. Univariate sensitivity analysis assessed parameter uncertainties. Results: Validation results at year 2 of disease progression fit with CDR-SB progression in LipiDiDiet. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) in the baseline case was €22,743/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). All scenarios rendered an ICUR lower than €25,000/QALY (the societal threshold). Moreover, the treatment option was cost-saving and increased health benefits when diagnostic costs were not considered and treatment was only administered during the prodromal stage. Conclusions: Treating prodromal AD with Souvenaid is a cost-effective intervention in all scenarios analysed. The LipiDiDiet trial showed a modest improvement in disease course but as the social costs of AD are very high, the intervention was efficient. Assessing small benefits at specific stages of AD is relevant because it is reasonable to expect that no effective, safe and affordable disease-modifying therapies will become available in the short to medium term. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 13:52:44,,,,1,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Clinical dementia rating; Cost-utility; Dementia; Prodromal Alzheimer’s disease; Souvenaid; Yes,0,1,1,0,ISPOR,0,Excel,0,,,,,,,,

However, EHR data lead to some limitations in understanding patient flow because they are manually entered and not updated in real time. Data generated from a real-time location system (RTLS) can supplement EHR data. This study aims to demonstrate how RTLS data combined with EHR data can be used to evaluate potential interventions to improve patient flow in an outpatient cancer center. METHODS EHR and RTLS data obtained from a large cancer center in central Virginia were analyzed to estimate process times and determine the various patient paths patients follow during their visit for infusion. Using the input data, we developed a discrete-event simulation (DES) model and assessed 5 what-if scenarios involving changes in staff scheduling and care processes. RESULTS Raw RTLS data including . 3.5 million observations were preprocessed to remove noise and extract meaningful information. The DES results showed that new nursing schedules for the infusion center and improved pharmacy processes have positive impacts on reducing patient waiting times by approximately 20% and overall length of stay by approximately 3.4% to 4.6%, compared with the current system.

Electronic health record systems will enable automated decision support to assist medical professionals in making these determinations. This article details a framework that uses a discrete-event simulation, programmed in Python, to determine how priorities should be assigned in real time based on characteristics of patient needs. The severity of patient needs is dynamic because severity increases over time until the need is addressed. The simulation framework is applied to a cardiac care unit with 14 patients, who collectively have 125 needs. Four different priority schemes are evaluated and their effectiveness compared under the assumption of an 8 or 9 nurse capacity. The results illustrate the importance of modeling the dispatching of nurses according to severity because, although fewer nurses result in longer average queue times, they can handle higher-severity needs effectively. © 2020 IEEE.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 14:56:12,,782-793,,,2020-December,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Yes; WSC,0,1,1,0,None,0,Python,1,,,,,,,,

It is important for management to keep track of this figure to proactively avoid overcrowding and maintain a high level of quality of care. The objective of this work consists in proposing a decision-aid tool for hospital managers allowing to decide on the bed requirements for a given hospital or network of hospitals on a short-medium term horizon. To that extent we propose a new data-driven discrete-event simulation model based on data from a French university hospital to predict bed and staff requirements. We propose a case study to illustrate the tool's ability to monitor bed occupancy in the recovery unit given the admission rate of ED patients during the pandemic of Sars-Cov-2.

The lack of downstream beds can deteriorate the quality of care for patients who need hospitalization after an ED visit. We propose a generic simulation model in order to analyze patient pathways from the ED to hospital discharge. The model is adaptable for all pathologies and can include several hospitals within a healthcare network. A pathway analysis using Process Mining is done in order to identify relevant pathways. Then we propose several designs of experiments in order to test medical unit capacity variations taking into account real data and practitioners expertise. A practical case study on stroke patient pathways in the Southern Brittany Hospital is proposed to illustrate the approach.

The constructed simulation models take into account the patient flow and patient behavior. At the same time, on-site surveying and monitoring data as well as realistic medical information are used as inputs for the simulation model.

Proper allocation of resources to match demand is, therefore, a vital task for many emergency departments. Constrained by targets on patient waiting time, we consider the problem of minimizing the total amount of staff-resources allocated to an emergency department. We test a matheuristic approach to this problem, accounting for both patient flow and staff scheduling restrictions. Using a continuous-time Markov chain, patient flow is modeled as a time-dependent queueing network where inhomogeneous behavior is evaluated using the uniformization method. Based on this modeling approach, we recursively evaluate and allocate staff to the system using integer linear programming until the waiting time targets are respected in all queues of the network. By comparing to discrete-event simulations of the associated system, we show that this approach is adequate for both modeling and optimizing the patient flow. In addition, we demonstrate robustness to the service time distribution and the associated system with multiple classes of patients. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 16:07:36,,94-105,,1,272,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,OR in health services; Queueing; Heuristics; Markov chain; Stochastic optimization; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Matlab,0,,,,,,,,

The aim of the project shown in this article is to develop a methodology able to improve non-clinical front office operation for the patients (like booking exams, delivering medical reports etc.), keeping the costs under control. The service center serves 600 users every day and it is the core of a great reorganization process, focused on centralization of office activities of the Careggi University Hospital of Florence, to ensure the best services to patients. For this reason, Discrete Event Simulation model (DES) have been used. The project of the model was made according to the real process observed during the confrontation with staff, document verification, field observation stage and study of data stored in hospital’s databases. These researches provided parameters necessary for model running, such as number of accesses, service time, available resources and patient’s waiting time. Validation confirmed that model is formally correct, and shown that waiting time of patients is substantially equal between real data and simulated outputs. The mean waiting time of all patients calculated by the model (7 min and 9 s) is only 2.6% lesser than real one (7 min and 20 s). Weekly workload of the model (3048 patients) is equal to reality, proving that the schedules of patient’s accesses are correct. We used a statistic test to confirm the results. This paper shows that DES is a valuable tool that can be used to save money and improve clinical processes. In the future this model will be used to evaluate the reorganization of the Service Center with the aim to allow everyone (not only technical staff) to use it, through a web-based support, a predictive machine and a user interface. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 15:16:05,,559-562,,,68,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,Issue: 1,,,,Discrete event simulation; Healthcare; Optimization; Front office service; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

TB persists in these populations through reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI) acquired before immigration. Those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for reactivation and may benefit from LTBI screening and treatment. Study Design: Health administrative data from British Columbia, Canada, were used to inform a cost-effectiveness analysis evaluating LTBI screening in those diagnosed with stage 4 or 5 CKD not requiring dialysis (late-stage CKD) and those who began dialysis therapy. Setting & Population: Permanent residents establishing residency in British Columbia, Canada, between 1985 and 2012 who had late-stage CKD diagnosed or began dialysis therapy. Interventions: Screening with the tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) compared to no LTBI screening at the time of late-stage CKD diagnosis and time of dialysis therapy initiation. Treatment for those who tested positive was isoniazid for 9 months. Outcomes: Costs (2016 Can $), TB cases, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for QALYs gained was calculated. Model, Perspective, & Timeframe: Discrete event simulation model using a health care system perspective, 1.5% discount rate, and 5-year time horizon. Results: Screening with IGRA was superior to the tuberculin skin test in all situations. Screening with IGRA was less expensive and resulted in better outcomes compared to no screening in those initiating dialysis therapy from countries with an elevated TB incidence. In individuals with late-stage CKD, screening with IGRA was only cost-effective in those 60 years or older (cost per QALY gained, <$48,000) from countries with an elevated TB incidence. Limitations: This study has limitations in generalizability to different epidemiologic settings and in modeling complicated clinical decisions. Conclusions: LTBI screening should be considered in non–Canadian-born residents initiating dialysis therapy and those with late stage CKD who are older. © 2018 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 16:01:17,,39-50,,1,73,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,cost-effectiveness analysis; screening; Canada; chronic kidney disease (CKD); dialysis; economic analysis; immigration; latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI); migrants; prevention; quality-adjusted life-year (QALY); reactivation; renal failure; Tuberculosis (TB); Yes,0,1,1,0,ISPOR,0,Simio,0,,,,,,,,Cites ISPOR but doesnt state compliance

The costs captured included community-based care, permanent and respite residential aged care, hospitalisation, transitional care, pharmaceuticals, aged care assessments, out of hospital medical services and other programs. Results: The costs borne for people with dementia in Australia are predicted to increase from A$11.8 billion in 2015 to A$33.6 billion in 2050 at 2013-14 prices, ceteris paribus.

Conclusions: This simulation provides useful estimates of the potential future costs that will be borne for people with dementia and allows the exploration of the effects of capacity constraints on these costs. The model demonstrates that the level of real annual per capita growth in health and social expenditure has significant implications for the future sustainability of dementia care in Australia. What is known about the topic?: With the aging of the Australian population, the number of people living with dementia is predicted to rise markedly in the next four decades.

Different strategies toward implementing competing risks in discrete-event simulation (DES) models are available. This study aims to provide recommendations regarding modeling approaches that can be defined based on these strategies by performing a quantitative comparison of alternative modeling approaches. Methods. Four modeling approaches were defined: 1) event-specific distribution (ESD), 2) event-specific probability and distribution (ESPD), 3) unimodal joint distribution and regression model (UDR), and 4) multimodal joint distribution and regression model (MDR). Each modeling approach was applied to uncensored individual patient data in a simulation study and a case study in colorectal cancer. Their performance was assessed in terms of relative event incidence difference, relative absolute event incidence difference, and relative entropy of time-to-event distributions. Differences in health economic outcomes were also illustrated for the case study. Results. In the simulation study, the ESPD and MDR approaches outperformed the ESD and UDR approaches, in terms of both event incidence differences and relative entropy. Disease pathway and data characteristics, such as the number of competing risks and overlap between competing time-to-event distributions, substantially affected the approaches’ performance. Although no considerable differences in health economic outcomes were observed, the case study showed that the ESPD approach was most sensitive to low event rates, which negatively affected performance. Conclusions. Based on overall performance, the recommended modeling approach for implementing competing risks in DES models is the MDR approach, which is defined according to the general strategy of selecting the time-to-event first and the corresponding event second. The ESPD approach is a less complex and equally performing alternative if sufficient observations are available for each competing event (i.e., the internal validity shows appropriate data representation). © The Author(s) 2018.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 14:28:21,,57-73,,1,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; competing events; competing risks; individual patient data; survival analysis; Yes,0,1,1,1,None,0,R,1,,,,personex,,,,https://personex.nl/research/competing-risks/

In this study, a model was developed to predict virus concentration on nurses’ hands using data from a bacteriophage tracer study conducted in Tucson, Arizona, in an urgent care facility. Surfaces were swabbed 2 hours, 3.5 hours, and 6 hours postseeding to measure virus spread over time. To estimate the full viral load that would have been present on hands without sampling, virus concentrations were summed across time points for 3.5- and 6-hour measurements. A stochastic discrete event model was developed to predict virus concentrations on nurses’ hands, given a distribution of virus concentrations on surfaces and expected frequencies of hand-to-surface and orifice contacts and handwashing. Box plots and statistical hypothesis testing were used to compare the model-predicted and experimentally measured virus concentrations on nurses’ hands. The model was validated with the experimental bacteriophage tracer data because the distribution for model-predicted virus concentrations on hands captured all observed value ranges, and interquartile ranges for model and experimental values overlapped for all comparison time points. Wilcoxon rank sum tests showed no significant differences in distributions of model-predicted and experimentally measured virus concentrations on hands. However, limitations in the tracer study indicate that more data are needed to instill more confidence in this validation. Next model development steps include addressing viral concentrations that would be found naturally in healthcare environments and measuring the risk reductions predicted for various infection control interventions. © 2019 Society for Risk Analysis",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 16:15:27,,1812-1824,,8,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,healthcare; Bacteriophage; exposure simulation; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,R,1,,,,,,,,

Simulation modeling is an economical approach to solve complex healthcare problems. We employed Discrete Event System Specification-JAVA (DEVS-JAVA) based model to simulate and test changes in emergency service conditions with an overall goal to improve ED patient flow. Initially, we developed a system based on ED data from South Carolina hospitals. Later, we ran simulations on four different case scenarios. 1. Optimum number (no.) of doctors and patients needed to reduce average (avg) time of assignment (avg discharge time = 33Â min). 2. Optimum no. of patients to reduce avg discharge time (avg wait time = 150Â min). 3. Optimum no. of patients to reduce avg directing time to critical care (avg wait time = 58Â min). 4. Optimum no. of patients to reduce avg directing time to another hospital (avg wait time = 93Â min). Upon execution of above 4 simulations, 4 patients got discharged utilizing 3 doctors; 5 patients could be discharged from ED to home; 2 patients could be transferred from ED to critical care; 3 patients could be transferred from ED to another hospital. Our results suggest that the generated DEVS-JAVA simulation method seems extremely effective to solve time-dependent healthcare problems. &#x00A9; 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 15:15:09,,,3,,11466 LNBI,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,Pages: 14 DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-17935-9_1,,,,Simulation; DEVS-JAVA; Emergency department (ED); Yes,0,1,1,1,None,0,DEVS Java,1,,Github,,,,,,No license

Discrete Event Simulation is normally applied for queuing system processes and for analysing individual criteria. On other hand, system dynamics is utilised to assess continuous and qualitative variables such as levels of stress. When combined in a hybrid model, these two techniques are capable to produce reliable outputs that will enhance the knowledge of the decision makers. There are two types of hybrid interaction, cyclic and parallel. Currently, simulation software does not support automated interaction, therefore, hy-bridisation is usually developed through manual linking of models. This paper is an extension paper from two previous papers that developed healthcare processes using hybrid simulation techniques to assess its viability over single technique usage. Based on the results from hybrid, it shows a marked difference compared with results from single techniques. Therefore, we conclude that hybrid simulation will gave better outputs for decision makers to consider. © 2019, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication.

Computed Tomography (CT) is one of the most important tools in diagnostic imaging. In Brazil, among medical imaging devices, 4.7% were CTs, representing eighth place in exam numbers and first in costs. The aim of this study was to simulate the installation of a new CT service with 1, 4, 16 or 128-slice devices, determining its profit after 3 years in a general hospital. To this end, exams were divided into six steps. Models were created in the MedModel® software and three years were simulated for a hospital operating 24 h/day. Two scenarios were simulated for four CT types with two values of exam increase rates (scenario 1 starting with 50 exams/month, with a small growth rate in the number of exams; and scenario 2 also starting with 50 exams/month, but with a greater growth rate). The costs for acquisition (new and used equipment), installation and operation were estimated, together with overall exam reimbursement values. None of the simulated CT models achieved profit after 36 months in scenario 1. In scenario 2, all simulated equipment were profitable after 36 months, except for the new 128-slice. In conclusion, the results indicate the need for a study of the expected number exams. The study shows the importance of knowing the real potential of a new medical service and the value of computer simulation tools in the design of a medical-hospital service. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 14:29:02,,761-765,,,70,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,Issue: 1,,,,Discrete event simulation; Computed tomography; Specifying; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,MedModel,0,,,,,,,,

Given the current opioid crises Canada is facing and the legalization of recreational cannabis in October 2018, the number of MHA visits to the ED is expected to grow even further. In face of these events, we examine capacity planning alternatives for the ED of an academic hospital in Toronto. We first quantify the volume of ED visits the hospital has received in recent years (from 2012 to 2016) and use forecasting techniques to predict future ED demand for the hospital. We then employ a discrete-event simulation model to analyze the impacts of the following scenarios: (a) increasing overall demand to the ED, (b) increasing or decreasing number of ED visits due to substance abuse, and (c) adjusting resource capacity to address the forecasted demand. Key performance indicators used in this analysis are the overall ED length of stay (LOS) and the total number of patients treated in the Psychiatric Emergency Services Unit (PESU) as a percentage of the total number of MHA visits. Our results showed that if resource capacity is not adjusted, ED LOS will deteriorate considerably given the expected growth in demand; programs that aim to reduce the number of alcohol and/or opioid visits can greatly aid in reducing ED wait times; the legalization of recreational use of cannabis will have minimal impact, and increasing the number of PESU beds can provide great aid in reducing ED pressure. © 2019 Deyvison T.

While earlier diagnostic screening results in greater capacity for early detection and treatment, such benefits must be balanced with the greater demands this imposes on public health services. To address such planning challenges, a multi-scale hybrid simulation model of DIP was built to explore the interaction of risk factors and capture the dynamics underlying the development of DIP. The impact of interventions on health outcomes at the physiological, health service and population level is measured. Of particular central significance in the model is a compartmental model representing the underlying physiological regulation of glycemic status based on beta-cell dynamics and insulin resistance. The model also simulated the dynamics of continuous BMI evolution, glycemic status change during pregnancy and diabetes classification driven by the individual-level physiological model. We further modeled public health service pathways providing diagnosis and care for DIP to explore the optimization of resource use during service delivery.

Methods: Using a discrete event simulation approach, we examined ECR performance under a range of possible scenarios and resource use configurations. Results: The model demonstrated the impact of competing emergency interventional cases upon ECR treatment times and time impact of allocating more physical (more angiographic suites) or staff resources (extending work hours).

A&ED are difficult to model due to the presence of interactions, different pathways and the multiple outcomes that patients may undertake depending on their health status. In addition, public concern has focused on the presence of overcrowding, long waiting times, patient dissatisfaction and cost overruns associated with A&ED. There is then a need for tackling these problems through developing integrated and explicit models supporting healthcare planning. However, the studies directly concentrating on modelling the A&EDs are largely limited. Therefore, this paper presents the use of a multi-phase DES framework for modelling the A&ED and facilitating the assessment of potential improvement strategies. Initially, the main components, critical variables and different states of the A&ED are identified to correctly model the entire patient journey. In this step, it is also necessary to characterize the demand in order to categorize the patients into pipelines. After this, a discrete-event simulation (DES) model is developed. Then, validation is conducted through the 2-sample t test to demonstrate whether the model is statistically comparable with the real-world A&ED department. This is followed by the use of Markov phase-type models for calculating the total costs of the whole system. Finally, various scenarios are explored to assess their potential impact on multiple outcomes of interest.

Additionally, it leads to an increased number of hospitalization and emergency department visits which augments the financial burden faced by healthcare systems. Despite these considerations, the studies directly concentrating on the reduction of appointment lead-time in these departments are largely limited. Therefore, this paper proposes the application of Discrete-event Simulation (DES) approach to evaluate potential improvement strategies aiming at reducing average appointment lead-time. Initially, the outpatient department is characterized to effectively identify the main activities, process variables, interactions, and system constraints. After data collection, input analysis is conducted through intra-variable independence, homogeneity and goodness-of-fit tests followed by the creation of a simulation model representing the real pediatric outpatient department. Then, Mann-Whitney tests are used to prove whether the model was statistically comparable with the real-world system. After this, the outpatient department performance is assessed in terms of average appointment lead-time and resource utilization. Finally, three improvement scenarios are assessed technically and financially, to determine if they are viable for implementation.

To date, no economic evaluations have assessed the cost-effectiveness of baricitinib in the Spanish setting. Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of baricitinib versus adalimumab for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active RA in the Spanish setting. Methods: A discrete event simulation model was developed in Microsoft Excel. Costs and outcomes were estimated over a lifetime horizon using the Spanish national payer perspective. The model compared baricitinib 4 mg once daily in combination with methotrexate with adalimumab 40mg every otherweek in combinationwithmethotrexate.Effectiveness and physical function were captured using the American College of Rheumatology criteria and the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, input values of which were derived from a phase 3, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trial (RA-BEAM; funded by Eli Lilly and Incyte; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01710358). Costs are presented in Euros, 2018 values. Results: In the base case analysis, baricitinib was associated with a quality-adjusted life year gain of 0.09 years over a lifetime horizon, at an incremental cost of -€558 versus adalimumab. Results of various scenario analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis generally were consistent with the base case analysis. Conclusion: This analysis suggests that baricitinib is a cost-effective treatment option compared to adalimumab for Spanish patients with moderately-to-severely active RA and a previous inadequate response or intolerance to csDMARD therapy. © 2019 Schlueter et al.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 14:58:51,,395-403,,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Cost-effectiveness; Adalimumab; Baricitinib; JAK inhibitor; Rheumatoid arthritis; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Excel,0,,,,,,,,

Using qualitative and quantitative methods we map the process, incorporating patient, staff and process related components so as to quantify resource utilisation and the service experienced by the patient. Method: In this study, semi structured interviews are used to identify patient complexity factors/characteristics. Process mapping and involvement of stakeholders are discussed as is the identification and analysis of data. A discrete event simulation (DES) model of the process is designed and performance metrics identified. Results: Yearly demand for Radiology services are increasing significantly. Factors determining patient complexity and variation include patient type, infectiousness, mobility, exam type and patient care needs. A strong correlation between age and infectiousness was observed. Conclusion: DES modelling, though data intensive, provides decision makers with insights into resource utilisation, process capacity, delays and disruptions and in doing so supports operations, management and the adoption of good practices in Healthcare.

Optimized treatment methods and integrated concepts of care are potential solutions to overcome increasing financial burdens and improve overall quality of care. In this work a novel heart failure treatment model based on agent based and discrete event methodologies is presented. The hybrid approach facilitates the incorporation of different therapeutic procedures for outpatient and inpatient care on a patient individual level. Simulation results for conventional care and the use case of an exemplary telemonitoring program give deeper insight into cost distribution between outpatient and inpatient care and showcase potential positive health and economic outcomes within two years for integrated care. The presented model allows performing extensive simulations of established treatment procedures for heart failure patients and evaluating new holistic methods of care and innovative study designs. This approach offers health care providers a unique, adaptable and comprehensive tool for decision making in the complex and socioeconomically challenging field of cardiovascular diseases.

Although shown to be effective in selected populations and studies, CAR T-cell technology requires considerable health care resources, which may lead to additional wait times to access this type of treatment in future. The objective of our study was to estimate the potential impact of increasing wait times on CAR T-cell therapy effectiveness compared with standard chemotherapy for patients with relapsed/ refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Methods: A health system-level discrete event simulation model was developed to project the potential impact of wait times on CAR T-cell therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Waiting queues and health states related to treatment and clinical progression were implemented. Using data from the literature, we evaluated nine scenarios of using CAR T-cell therapy with wait times ranging from 1 to 9 months. The outcome of interest was 1-year all-cause mortality. Results: Increasing the wait time of receiving CAR T-cell therapy from 1 to 9 months increased the predicted 1-year mortality rate from 36.1% to 76.3%. Baseline 1-year mortality was 34.0% in patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy with no wait times and 75.1% in patients treated with chemotherapy. This resulted in an increased relative mortality rate of 6.2% to 124.5% over a 1- to 9-month wait time compared with no wait time. Conclusion: We found that modest delays in CAR T-cell therapy significantly hinder its effectiveness. Because CAR T-cell therapy offers a potential cure, it is expected that the uptake rate will be substantially increased once the therapy is regularly funded by a health care system. Wait times may be prolonged if system resource availability does not match the demand. Strategies must be developed to minimize the impact of delays and reduce complications during waiting. © 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 15:42:30,,1-9,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,R Simmer,1,,,,,,,,

Inefficient patients’ transportation throughout the facility can create bottlenecks and crowding, compromise care and trust, and possibly lead to increased costs. Thus, having a streamlined and efficient workflow that ensures timely patient transport is crucial to ensure patient satisfaction and hospital throughput. Currently, the unit receives complaints from different areas of the hospital that patients are not assigned a transport in a timely manner. The average waiting time and total service time do not meet the department’s service level target. This research develops an integer programming model and a discrete-event simulation to standardize the patient transport process and to optimize the manpower planning of the system. The proposed study ensures optimal staffing that corresponds to the required workload to eliminate the bottlenecks in patient flow across the hospital. Implementing the optimized schedules (staffing to workload) reduces the average waiting time to less than 10 minutes, allowing the transporters to handle more caseloads while satisfying service level goals. A standardized plan has also been implemented to ensure the sustainability of the new processes. © 2019 IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2019.

Designing, planning, improving and controlling this system can be very challenging due to the system complexity governed by several subjective factors that affect the hospital interrelated functions or services. However, continuously changing health care needs that consistently face hospitals require them to keep continuously improving the efficiency of these services as demand increases and as new services are added. This paper proposes a new methodology that uses the concept of Digital Twin (DT) of hospital services based on Discrete Event Simulation (DES) integrated with health care information systems and Internet of things (IoT) devices. It develops a predictive decision support model that employs real-time services data drawn from these systems and devices. This model enables assessing the efficiency of existing health care delivery systems and evaluating the impact of changes in services without disrupting daily activities of the hospital. The developed model, a digital twin (or a virtual replica of the hospital), simulates a number of key hospital health delivery services, based on relevant data retrieved in real-time. Although the model simulates four key services, initially as a proof of concept, but it proposes a general framework, which can be expanded to include other services. The demonstrated proof-of-concept shows that it achieves better planning and improvement of usage of resources, and thus enabling both practitioners and management to examine any model changes to foresee the effectiveness or efficiency of services before they are applied in reality. © 2018 IEEE.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 15:25:11,,,,,2018-November,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,DES; Digital Twin; Hospital Services; IOT; Pervasive Computing; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Flexsim,0,,,,,,,,

The process improvement team conducted a feasibility study to validate the possibility of integration of these departments and their combined workflow based on observations, capacity analysis, and current state assessment. This study proposes integration between simulation-based optimization and integer programming for staffing and scheduling of medical resources. Simulation-based optimization allows us to conduct a sensitivity analysis with various staff levels to improve utilization. While integer programming minimizes cost by assigning staff into appropriate shifts based on the results from the simulation-based optimization model. The overall research goal includes increasing resource utilization and reducing total operations cost while maintaining an appropriate staff level.

This elderly population will grow tremendously in the United States over the next decade, resulting in short- and long-term challenges of matching resource capacity with uncertain demand for hospitals and other healthcare providers. This paper describes research involving the development of a simulation model of patient flow in order to understand the relationship between capacity and demand, and to investigate the impacts on performance measures such as average wait times for LTC patients. We propose an aggregate capacity model to consider patient flow among various types of care providers by integrating hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and home health care. Using the data including patient demographics and service provider information, we forecast patient demand for LTC.

Computer simulation models can overcome these difficulties, and offer evidence on which to base policy and decisions. In this paper a discrete event simulation model is described, designed to analyze prehospital policies and commonly made decisions. We studied an airplane crash scenario and analyzed mortality as a primary and treatment and transport times as secondary outcome measures. We implemented resource dispatching, search and rescue at the disaster site, triage, treatment and evacuation of victims to healthcare facilities.

With increasing health care spending and drug prices, it is important to quantify the value of newly available treatment options for PMO. Objective: To determine cost-effectiveness of ABL compared with teriparatide (TPTD) for treatment of women with PMO in the United States. Methods: A discrete-event simulation (DES) model was developed to assess cost-effectiveness of ABL from the US health care perspective. The model included three 18-month treatment strategies with either placebo (PBO), TPTD, or ABL, all followed by additional 5-year treatment with alendronate (ALN). High-risk patients were defined as women with PMO ⩾65 years old with a prior vertebral fracture. Baseline clinical event rates, risk reductions, and patient characteristics were based on the Abaloparatide Comparator Trial in Vertebral Endpoints (ACTIVE) trial. Results: Over a 10-year period, the DES model yielded average total discounted per-patient costs of $10 212, $46 783, and $26 837 and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 6.742, 6.781, and 6.792 for PBO/ALN, TPTD/ALN, and ABL/ALN, respectively. Compared with TPTD/ALN, ABL/ALN accrued higher QALYs at lower cost and produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $333 266/QALY relative to PBO/ALN. In high-risk women, ABL/ALN also had more QALYs and less cost over TPTD/ALN and yielded an ICER of $188 891/QALY relative to PBO/ALN.

One approach to reduce queue length is for specialists to review referrals through an electronic consultation (e-consult) and determine if 1) the patient requires a specialty appointment or 2) the primary care physician can continue care with the specialist's recommendations. As inappropriate patients are removed from specialty queues, it is hypothesized that lead times will decrease and the system will be more efficient at delivering the right care to the right patient at the right time. A discrete-event simulation was built to estimate the impact e-consults have on Rheumatology clinics at Duke Health; specifically considering lead time, queue length, and specialists' workload. This is an adaptable tool with visualizations for which any specialty clinic, each with its own complex challenges, could estimate the impact e-consults have on delivering quality care to referred patients. © 2018 IEEE",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 16:06:13,,2589-2599,,,2018-December,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Yes; WSC,0,1,1,0,None,0,R,1,,,,,,,,

It is unknown whether broader geographic sharing of donor lungs would improve lung transplant waitlist outcomes. METHODS: A discrete event microsimulation model simulated donor lung allocation according to different geographic lung-sharing policies, including the historic local donor service area (DSA)-based policy and hypothetical policies that prioritize candidates to donors within 500-mile or 1,000-mile geographic radii. Candidate waitlist mortality, number of transplants, and 1-year survival were compared across organ allocation policies. Waitlist mortality rates were further stratified by diagnosis, Lung Allocation Score (LAS) threshold, ABO blood type, and region. RESULTS: Under broader geographic lung sharing, the proportion of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease transplant recipients decreased, whereas the proportion of pulmonary fibrosis recipients increased. Waitlist mortality decreased with broader geographic lung sharing with a 21.3% decrease in waitlist mortality with 500-mile lung sharing and a 31.8% decrease in waitlist mortality with 1,000-mile lung sharing. The decrease in waitlist deaths occured across all U.S. geographic regions and was greatest in candidates with pulmonary fibrosis and/or high medical urgency. CONCLUSIONS: Broader geographic sharing of donor lungs could reduce waitlist mortality, particularly among pulmonary fibrosis and high-medical-urgency candidates. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 15:16:26,,136-144,,2,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,disparities; lung transplant; organ allocation; waitlist; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Excel,0,,,,,,,,

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd and Erasmus University Rotterdam were commissioned as the Evidence Review Group for this submission. The Evidence Review Group reviewed the evidence submitted by the manufacturer, corrected and validated the manufacturer’s decision analytic model, and conducted exploratory analyses to assess the robustness and validity of the presented clinical and cost-effectiveness results. This article describes the company submission, the Evidence Review Group assessment and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence subsequent decisions. The main clinical effectiveness evidence was obtained from the MONALEESA-2 trial, a randomised controlled trial comparing ribociclib plus letrozole with placebo plus letrozole. Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ribociclib group (95% confidence interval, 19.3–not reached) vs. 14.7 months (95% confidence interval 13.0–16.5) in the placebo group. To assess the cost effectiveness of ribociclib in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, the company developed an individual patient-level model using a discrete-event simulation approach in Microsoft ® Excel. In the model, simulated patients move through a series of three health states until death, i.e. first-line progression-free survival, second-line progression-free survival and progressive disease. The length of progression-free survival during the first line was informed by the MONALEESA-2 trial. The benefit in progression-free survival in the first line was transferred to a benefit in overall survival assuming full progression-free survival to overall survival surrogacy (because of the immaturity of overall survival data from the MONALEESA-2 trial). Patient-level data from the BOLERO-2 trial, evaluating the addition of everolimus to exemestane in the second-line treatment of postmenopausal HR-positive advanced breast cancer, were used to inform the length of progression-free survival during the second line. Costs included in the model were treatment costs (e.g. technology acquisition costs of first, second, third and/or later line treatments), drug administration costs, monitoring costs and health state costs (including terminal care). Additionally, the costs of adverse events associated with the first-line treatment were incorporated. The Evidence Review Group recalculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using data from a different data cut-off date from the MONALEESA-2 trial and by changing some assumptions (e.g. progression-free survival to overall survival surrogacy approach and post-progression third and/or later line treatment-related costs). After two appraisal committee meetings and a revised base case submitted by the company (including a second enhanced patient access scheme discount), the committee concluded that taking into account the uncertainties in the calculation of the cost effectiveness, there were plausible cost-effectiveness estimates broadly in the range that could be considered as a cost-effective use of National Health Service resources. Therefore, ribociclib was recommended as a treatment option for the first-line treatment of hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer, contingent on the company providing ribociclib with the discount agreed in the second enhanced patient access scheme. © 2018, The Author(s).",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 15:57:27,,141-153,,2,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Excel,0,,,,,,,,

We identified the range of drug costs for which RIB could be considered cost effective from a Chinese perspective. Methods: A discrete event simulation model was developed to model the treatment sequences among patients with ABC. Life years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs) and lifetime costs were estimated. Costs were estimated for Chinese health care systems. Three times the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of China 2016 ($24,360) and three times the per capita GDP of Beijing city 2016 ($53,384) were used as the willingness-to-pay threshold. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: In the base case analysis, RIB + LET provided an incremental survival benefit of 0.631 LYs and 0.451 QALYs. When RIB costs less than $721 or $1170 per 4 weeks, there was a nearly 90% likelihood that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for RIB + LET would be less than $24,360 per QALY or $53,384 per QALY, respectively. Conclusion: A value-based price for the cost of RIB is $732 or $1170 per 4 weeks for China and Beijing City, respectively.

We report the development, validation, and implementation of an open-source population-based outcomes model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for Canada. Methods. Evaluation Platform in COPD (EPIC) is a discrete-event simulation model of Canadians 40 years of age or older. Three core features of EPIC are its open-population design (incorporating projections of future population growth, aging, and smoking trends), its incorporation of heterogeneity in lung function decline and burden of exacerbations, and its modeling of the natural history of COPD from inception. Multiple original data analyses, as well as values reported in the literature, were used to populate the model. Extensive face validity and internal and external validity evaluations were performed. Results. The model was internally validated on demographic projections, mortality rates, lung function trajectories, COPD exacerbations, costs and health state utility values, and stability of COPD prevalence over time within strata of risk factors. In external validation, it moderately overestimated the rate of overall exacerbations in 2 independent trials but generated consistent estimates of rate of severe exacerbations and mortality. Limitations. In its current version, EPIC does not consider uncertainty in the evidence. Several components such as additional (e.g., environmental and occupational) risk factors, treatment, symptoms, and comorbidity will have to be added in future iterations. Predictive validity of EPIC needs to be examined prospectively against future empirical studies. Conclusions. EPIC is the first multipurpose, open-source, outcome- and policy-focused model of COPD for Canada. Platforms of this type have the capacity to be iteratively updated to incorporate the latest evidence and to project the outcomes of many different scenarios within a consistent framework. © The Author(s) 2019.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 15:15:31,,152-167,,2,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,cost-effectiveness analysis; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; disease simulation; epidemiological projection; whole-disease modeling; Yes,0,1,1,1,ISPOR,0,R,1,,Github,,https://resp.core.ubc.ca/research/Specific_Projects/EPIC,,,GNU General Public License,GNU General Public License

To delay the spread, health screening stations may be set up at airport terminals to screen travelers. This research tested three different health screening strategies, each with a different combination of screening stations at trip origins, destinations and connecting airports. Discrete event simulations were performed, based on the 2014 to 2016 Ebola virus epidemic, with special focus on travelers from the West African countries traveling to the United States, including travelers who transferred flights at airports in European Union member states. The effectiveness of the screening strategies was analyzed in terms of correct detection, missed detection and false alarm rate. The results showed that exit screening at trip origins brought big improvements in the performance measurements compared to no screening. However, additional screening at the destinations and connecting airports contributed marginal benefits. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 15:39:08,,27-38,,,75,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Simulation; Infectious disease; Air transportation; Detection rate; Ebola; Health screening; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Simio,0,,,,,,,,

Methods: The choice of patient characteristics and outcomes to include in the model was based on 3 literature reviews on multidimensional prognostic COPD indices, COPD phenotypes, and treatment effects in subgroups. A conceptual model was constructed including 14 patient characteristics, 7 intermediate outcomes (lung function, physical activity, exercise capacity, symptoms, disease-specific quality of life, exacerbations, and pneumonias), and 3 final outcomes (mortality, quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs], and costs). Regression equations describing the statistical associations between the patient characteristics and intermediate and final outcomes were estimated using the longitudinal data of 5 large COPD trials (19,378 patients). A patient-level simulation model was developed in which individual patients from the baseline population of the 5 trials are sampled and their outcomes over lifetime are predicted based on the regression equations. Results: The base-case analysis (single-arm simulation representing treatment with tiotropium) showed that patients had a mean lung function decline of 43 mL/year, 0.62 exacerbations/year, a worsening of their physical activity and quality of life with 1.48 and 1.10 points/year, a life expectancy of 11.2 years, 7.25 QALYs, and total lifetime costs of £24,891. Results for a selection of treatment scenarios and subgroups were shown to demonstrate the potential of the model.

This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of RAMP-DM over lifetime. Methods: We built a Discrete Event Simulation model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of RAMP-DM over lifespan from public health service provider’s perspective. Transition probabilities among disease states were extrapolated from a cohort of 17,140 propensity score matched participants in RAMP-DM and those under usual primary care over 5-year’s follow-up. The mortality of patients with specific DM-related complications was estimated from a cohort of 206,238 patients with diabetes. Health preference and direct medical costs of DM patients referred to our previous studies among Chinese DM patients. Results: RAMP-DM individuals gained 0.745 QALYs and cost US$1404 less than those under usual care. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that RAMP-DM had 86.0% chance of being cost-saving compared to usual care under the assumptions and estimates used in the model. The probability of RAMP-DM being cost-effective compared to usual care would be over 99%, when the willingness to pay threshold is HK$20,000 (US$ 2564) or higher. Conclusion: RAMP-DM added to usual primary care was cost-saving in managing people with diabetes over lifetime.

Design/methodology/approach: This study’s framework was based on a discrete event simulation (DES) to identify the as-is pharmacy process and to create a to-be (future situation) to achieve an improvement in pharmacy workflow and service quality. Owing to healthcare environment complexity, and to gain a deeper understanding about Al Buraimi Hospital pharmacy problems, a Delphi technique was also used. Findings: Based on Delphi, and according to the expert panel suggestions, two alternative scenarios were proposed to improve Al Buraimi Hospital pharmacy efficiency: fast-track and direct-dispensing, which should help to reduce the prescription dispensing waiting time process by 7.3 and 9.8 min, respectively. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation is the pharmacists’ shortage, which may affect the prescription dispensing process’s quality as insufficient manpower to check the prescriptions may increase the medication errors’ risk.

Typically, these targets are presented as percentiles of patients to be seen within specified timeframes. These targets present hospital administrators with a resourcing problem complicated by conflicting objectives: How to minimize costs while maximizing throughput to achieve the performance targets? In this paper, we describe the use of a simulation model to evaluate the effect of changes to staff levels in a cytology department, investigating the trade-off between staff levels and turnaround times in light of performance targets specified by government. Standard practice for determining staffing levels in a cytology department uses average workload estimates and does not take into account target performance measures, task variability, and the interruptive nature of the workload of pathologists. We develop a simulation model for pathologist workload within a cytology department in New Zealand. We describe the model construction process that follows the hierarchical control conceptual modeling (HCCM) framework. We use the resulting simulation model to examine the trade-offs between staffing levels (and associated rosters) and task turnaround time. The results indicate that consideration of variation in task arrivals is important when considering the effect of staffing levels on turnaround time. Furthermore, as the cytology department is required to meet performance targets that involve maximum service times for a percentile of patients, such an approach is necessary in order to estimate the performance level of a staffing roster. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 15:36:58,,e1119-e1134,,2,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; performance targets; resource planning; staffing levels; trade-offs; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,FlexSim,0,,,,,,,,Cites previous publication - no reporting guidelines or model

Approximately 40% of patients with focal epileptic seizures remain uncontrolled with antiepileptic drug (AED) monotherapy or polytherapy. Lacosamide has been recently approved by the European Medicines Agency as monotherapy for the treatment of focal seizures. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of lacosamide compared with zonisamide as first-line treatment of focal epilepsy in patients with epilepsy aged ≥ 16 years to inform clinical decision-making in Greece. Methods: A discrete event simulation model was adapted to reflect treatment pathways and resource use within the Greek national healthcare system, as specified by clinical experts. The model captures time-varying events and patient characteristics. Clinical inputs were sourced from pivotal trials and a network meta-analysis comparing lacosamide with other AEDs. The model predicts disease progression and seizures, relevant and most common adverse events, withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse events, and epilepsy-specific and all-cause mortality over a 2-year time horizon. Unit costs were retrieved from published Greek sources. Health outcomes were measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); secondary outcome was the cost per seizure avoided. Robustness of the results was tested with univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: The lacosamide treatment pathway was associated with higher costs (i.e. €1,064) and an additional 0.119 QALYs when compared with zonisamide, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €8,938 per QALY gained. The sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the results are most sensitive to the efficacy and utility estimates. Limitations: There are a number of limitations which stem from the process of model adaptation and lack of local real-world evidence. Conclusions: Lacosamide is a cost-effective option at a willingness-to-pay threshold of €30,000 per QALY, representing a valuable monotherapy treatment option for patients with focal epileptic seizures in the Greek setting. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 15:46:03,,359-364,,4,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,economic evaluation; Epilepsy; first-line treatment; Greece; lacosamide; Yes,0,1,1,0,ISPOR,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,

A neurology clinic including 8 doctors with different specialties is investigated. First, an interview and observation was done and then, required data relating patients' traffic were recorded and used for simulation. To analyze case study, first, bottlenecks were identified. It was observed that mean waiting time (MWT) of patients in total reception was high. For improving MWF, some scenarios were defined. Among all scenarios, increasing the number of nurses in the reception unit was the most effective one. The results of DES shows that by increasing the number of nurses to 4 individuals, the MWT can be decreased 8.345 minutes per day for each patient. Also, the utilization of doctors can be increased considerably. For validation, the results of the simulation were compared with real data by statistical analysis.

The service performance of an emergency department is influenced by internal factors, such as physical damage and staff availability, and external factors, such as an increased patient arrival rate and disruptions in its supply chain. This research presents a quantification methodology for the performance of the emergency department. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the explicit integration of the inelastic structural and nonstructural response of the building and damage with its loss of functionality, downtime, and emergency patient treatment rate. A discrete event simulation model is used to model the flow of patients within the different units of the emergency department. The seismic risk is expressed as return periods of exceeding different levels of patient waiting times. Results show that 1,000 and 30,000 accumulated waiting hours correspond to return periods of 100 and 1,000 years, respectively.

This article discusses a simulation that uses data analytics to minimize the number of physicians and nurses needed in healthcare facilities during a crisis situation. Using a hypothetical emergency scenario, the hospital uses a healthcare analytical system to predict the necessary resources to govern the situation. Based on historical data regarding the flow of patients through the facility, a discrete-event simulation estimates resource scheduling and the resulting impact on both wait times and personnel demand. Furthermore, the value of multiple replications for discrete-event simulation models is discussed and defined, along with factors that enable greater control of multiple design points with this simulated experiment. The results of this study demonstrate the value of simulation modeling in effective resource planning.

Medical institutions now face a situation where they must actively cope with internal and external changes in the market. The first priority in this situation should be the patients’ satisfaction of service, as they are the customers. As one of the major medical institutions, health examination centers are relatively more influenced by spatial services such as congestion and time delays. The reasons are due to standardized costs as well as the fact that they are less affected by medical technology or medical equipment. However, health examination centers need to establish optimal alternatives in limited circumstances due to limited space and manpower. Furthermore, they need to shut down the system to improve the space. Discrete event simulation is receiving the spotlight as a solution to solve these issues. It is also actively used as an analysis tool for research on complex situations such as medical facilities. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify a way to reduce waiting time at the health examination center from a spatial perspective by using discrete event simulation. This study applied discrete event simulation to the floor plan of a health examination center at the time of opening and the current operating floor plan to compare and analyze the spatial efficiency according to the standard examination process. A new floor plan that improves the problems derived from the analysis process was then established to quantitatively and qualitatively verify the degree of improvement. As indicators for quantitative evaluation, we proposed and measured the examinee processing time(D), the average examination time per person(P), and the number of people waiting per examination item(q) for 100 people. We also performed an intuitive evaluation based on heat map analysis and the distribution of examination time. For the reliability of the analytical data, we repeated the simulation 10 times and applied the mean value. The current operating floor plan reduced the examination processing time for 100 people by 15.29% and the average examination time per person by 11.64% compared to the plan at the time of opening. We also found that the highly congested waiting area of the turnaround section in the south and east corridors moved to the east corridor and that the homogeneity of examination time per person improved. This improvement is considered as a result of experience from operating for a considerable period of time after opening. As a result of proposing and analyzing the improvement plan that partially adjusted the number of services and the layout of examination rooms to distribute the concentrated queues in the narrow corridor space, the examination time per person could be further reduced by 7.02% compared to the current operating floor plan. Moreover, the public space could be used more homogeneously due to the wider use of the waiting space(corridor). Discrete event simulation shows that preliminary verification, configuring alternatives, and preparing reliable improvement plans is possible even without stopping system operations. More optimized results can be obtained by applying this theory to the initial design stage in addition to maximizing cost savings. However, discrete event simulation is an operational (low-abstract) model that is applicable to a relatively small independent space. If we integrate modular DES with Strategic Models such as System Dynamic (SD), we may be able to perform macro-level analyses. Therefore, follow-up studies will be required in the future. © BEIESP.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 14:27:46,,1037-1044,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; Complex system; Examinee queue; Health examination center; Pedestrian density; Pedestrian model; Yes,0,0,1,0,None,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,

More importantly, it explores how new technology such as electronic medical records, real-time location services (RTLS), and other simulation methods such as space syntax analysis (SSA) can facilitate and complement DES. Background: Healthcare administrators increasingly recognize DES as an effective tool for allocating resources and process improvement. However, limited studies have described specifically how DES can facilitate healthcare design. Method: Three case studies were provided to illustrate the value of DES in supporting healthcare design. The first case study used DES to validate a surgical suite design for shorter surgeon walking distance. The second case study used DES to facilitate capacity planning in a clinic through testing the utilization of exam rooms upon various growth scenario. The detailed process data for the current clinic were captured through RTLS tracking. The third case study applied DES in an emergency department for both site selection in master planning and capacity test at various growth scenarios with seasonal volume swing. In addition, SSA was conducted to evaluate the impacts of design on visual surveillance, team communication, and co-awareness. Conclusions: It is recognized that the DES analysis is an effective tool to address the process aspects of healthcare environments and should be combined with post-occupancy evaluation and SSA to address behavioral aspects of operations to provide more solid evidence for future design. © The Author(s) 2018.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 16:14:04,,89-106,,3,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,process improvement; discrete event simulation (DES); capacity planning; case studies; decision-making; performance-driven design; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,

Background: It can be challenging for hospital managers to quantify the impact of changing operational policy and technical design such as nurse–patient ratios on nurse workload and care quality. Planning tools are needed—discrete event simulation is a potential solution. Method: Using discrete event simulation, a demonstrator “Simulated Care Delivery Unit” model was created to predict the effects of varying nurse–patient ratios. Modelling inputs included the following: patient care data (GRASP systems data), inpatient unit floor plan and operating logic. Model outputs included the following: nurse workload in terms of task-in-queue, cumulative distance walked and Care quality in terms of task in queue time, missed care. Results: The model demonstrated that as NPR increases, care quality deteriorated (120% missed care; 20% task-in-queue time) and nursing workload increased (120% task-in-queue; 110% cumulative walking distance). Conclusions: DES has the potential to be used to inform operational policy and technical design decisions, in terms of impacts on nurse workload and care quality.

Simulation modelling has been used to inform the optimal scale and professional mix of services required to match patient demand. The context and the value of simulation modelling in service planning remain unclear. We aimed to examine the adoption, context and costs of using simulation modelling recommendations to inform service planning. Methods: Using an implementation science approach, we undertook a prospective, qualitative evaluation to assess the use of discrete event simulation modelling recommendations for service re-design and to explore stakeholder perspectives about the role of simulation modelling in service planning. Five orthopaedic and neurosurgical services in Queensland, Australia, were selected to maximise variation in implementation effectiveness. We used the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR) to guide the facilitation and analysis of the stakeholder focus group discussions. We conducted a prospective costing analysis in each service to estimate the costs associated with using simulation modelling to inform service planning. Results: Four of the five services demonstrated adoption by inclusion of modelling recommendations into proposals for service re-design. Four CFIR constructs distinguished and two CFIR constructs did not distinguish between high versus mixed implementation effectiveness. We identified additional constructs that did not map onto CFIR. The mean cost of implementation was AU$34,553 per site (standard deviation = AU$737). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first time the context of implementing simulation modelling recommendations in a health care setting, using a validated framework, has been examined.

More services are required to meet demand and ensure patients are seen within clinically recommended timeframes. Methods: A discrete event simulation model was developed to project endoscopy waiting list outcomes for two large metropolitan health services encompassing 8 public hospitals in Australia. The model applied routinely collected health service data to forecast the impacts of future endoscopic demand over 5 years and to identify the level of service activity required to address patient waiting times and meet key policy targets. The approach incorporated evidence from the literature to produce estimates of cost-effectiveness by showing longer term costs and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) associated with service expansion. Results: The modelling revealed that doing nothing would lead to the number of patients waiting longer than clinically recommended doubling across each health service within 5 years. A 38% overall increase in the number of monthly procedures available was required to meet and maintain a target of 95-98% of patients being seen within clinically recommended timeframes to the year 2021. This was projected to cost the funder approximately $140 million in additional activity over a 5 year period. Due to improved patient outcomes associated with timely intervention, it was estimated that the increased activity would generate over 22,000 additional QALYs across the two health services. This translated to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $6467 and $5974 per QALY for each health service respectively. Conclusions: Discrete event simulation modelling provided a rational, data based approach that allowed decision makers to quantify the future demand for endoscopy services and identify cost-effective strategies to meet community needs. © 2019 The Author(s).",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 16:11:44,,,,1,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; Cost-effectiveness; Model; Endoscopy; Service planning; Waiting list; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,AnyLogic,0,,,,,,data,,Data available on request

Materials and methods: Discrete-event simulation was used to model implementation of the LA treatment pathway in the ED versus standard care from the US Medicare perspective. Model inputs were derived from published sources to simulate a real-world hospital ED with an observation unit. Outcomes included key ED metrics such as patient throughput rate and length of stay (LOS) and cost (estimated through reimbursed amounts in 2017 USD). Results: Implementation of an LA pathway in the ED improved ABSSSI patient throughput rate by 350% (+5.8 dispositions/ED and observation unit day) and reduced LOS by 68% (−7.2 h/patient). These improvements in patient outcomes are driven by the reduced infusion time required for LA antibiotics and are greater for dalbavancin than oritavancin owing to the shorter infusion duration (30 min vs. 3 h). Limitations: External validity of the model was not assessed. The model was limited to care received in EDs; therefore, certain clinical variables outside the ED were not captured for this analysis. Conclusions: LA pathway implementation for ABSSSI treatment in the ED supported improved efficiency, which may translate to economic value. As EDs continue to focus on improving key metrics such as throughput rate and LOS, LA pathway implementation should be considered as a potential approach for abbreviated ABSSSI treatment in the ED. © 2019, © 2019 Allergan PLC.

This paper analyzes several appointment scheduling policies of the literature and proposes the most suitable to a bariatric surgery clinic, considering the following complexity factors: (i) stochastic service times, (ii) patient unpunctuality, (iii) service interruptions, and (iv) patient no-shows. Materials and Methods: We conducted the study using data collected in a bariatric surgery clinic located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The dataset presented 1468 appointments from June 29, 2015, to June 29, 2016. We comparatively evaluate the main literature policies through a discrete event simulation (DES). Results: The proposed policy (IICR) provides a 30% increase in attendance and allows a decrease in the total cost, maintaining the level of service in terms of average waiting time. Conclusion: IICR was successfully implemented, and the practical results were very close to the simulated ones. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 16:05:19,,2824-2830,,9,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Computer simulation; Operations management; Appointment scheduling; Bariatric clinic; Health care sector; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,ProModel,0,,,,,,,,

Emergency Departments in Kosovo for a long time are struggling for long waiting times for patients as well as delays and obstacles in health services. Healthcare systems are usually characterized by its complexity due to the variability and stochastic nature of the various processes involved in the flow of patient staff and supportive resources. To increase the use of existing human and technological resources and reduce patient waiting during this work, a methodology of system improvement has been used that involves simulating discrete events and analyzing the process. The use of different methodologies and tools to support the decision-makmg process is a key issue. This research presents a new approach to healthcare services in which Discrete Simulation Simulation and Multi-Objective Optimization Simulation are used. The methodology applied for the analysis of the improvement of the health care system in an Emergency Department at the Regional Hospital of Peja. As a result, decision-makers are given a set of almost optimal solutions and rules that significantly reduce the length of stay and the waiting time for emergency department patients. Fit solutions include the optimal number of resources and the required level of improvement in key processes at the Emergency Department. In the end, will be presented and discussed over the benefits achieved by applying this methodology, which has proved to be very valuable to support decision-making in designing and improving the complex healthcare system. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

To this end, it is required to optimize medical scheduling for clinicians. A typical approach for deriving the optimized schedules is to perform experiments using discrete event simulation. The existing work has developed how to build a simulation model based on process mining techniques. However, applying this method for outpatient processes straightforwardly, in particular medical scheduling, is challenging: 1) the collected data from electronic health record system requires a series of processes to acquire simulation parameters from the raw data; and 2) even if the derived simulation model fully reflects the reality, there is no systematic approach to deriving effective improvements for simulation analysis, i.e., experimental scenarios. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel decision support framework for a clinician's schedule using simulation analysis. In the proposed framework, a data-driven simulation model is constructed based on process mining analysis, which includes process discovery, patient arrival rate analysis, and service time analysis. Also, a series of steps to derive the optimal improvement method from the simulation analysis is included in the framework. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we present the case study results with real-world data in a hospital. © 2013 IEEE.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-26 16:45:28,,15239-15249,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Simulation modeling; experimental analyses; personal clinician schedules; process mining; waiting time for consultation; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Automod,0,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the health examination center is emerging from a medical auxiliary facility to a key and independent medical facility. However, medical facilities are not easy to design and improve because of the complex relationship between humans and space and the variable characteristics of humans. Methods/Statistical analysis: This study used a medical examination center currently in operation as an example to analyze the issues and develop improved methods of applying a pedestrian-based discrete event simulation. Four evaluation and verification indicators were presented for the evaluation and a simulation analysis tool was developed to derive the indicators. After identifying the examination time and the number of people to be accommodated through the simulation, the problems were derived based on the flow of human traffic and cause of queues. After resolving the problems by reducing the waiting time through adjusting the number of services and improving the spatial awareness by rearranging the space, the effects of reducing the waiting time, increasing the number of people accommodated, and shortening the moving distance were demonstrated through verification analysis. Findings: As a result of the study, the main reasons that extend the overall examination time was due to the increase and concentration of queues, which means that adjusting the number of services and the distribution of the queues to the services greatly helped to reduce the overall examination time. Improvements/Applications: This study is a basic research intended to develop a program for analyzing the spatial environment of examination centers. Further studies will be performed to complement tasks such as improving spatial recognition by analyzing the examination sequence and improving data reliability through repeated simulations. © 2019 SERSC.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-26 16:43:08,,140-155,,4,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; Agent-based model; Medical facility; Spatial structure; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,AnyLogic,0,,,,,,,,

Optimized treatment methods and integrated concepts of care are potential solutions to overcome increasing financial burdens and improve quality of care. In this context modeling is a powerful tool to evaluate potential benefits of different treatment procedures on health outcomes as well as health care budgets. This work presents a novel modeling approach for simulating different treatment procedures of heart failure patients based on extensive data sets from outpatient and inpatient care. Methods: Our hybrid heart failure model is based on discrete event and agent based methodologies and facilitates the incorporation of different therapeutic procedures for outpatient and inpatient care on patient individual level. The state of health is modeled with the functional classification of the New York Heart Association (NYHA), strongly affecting discrete state transition probabilities alongside age and gender. Cooperation with Austrian health care and health insurance providers allowed the realization of a detailed model structure based on clinical data of more than 25,000 patients. Results: Simulation results of conventional care and a telemonitoring program underline the unfavorable prognosis for heart failure and reveal the correlation of NYHA classes with health and economic outcomes. Average expenses for the treatment of NYHA class IV patients of €10,077 ± €165 were more than doubled compared to other classes. The selected use case of a telemonitoring program demonstrated potential cost savings within two years of application. NYHA classes II and III revealed most potential for additional treatment measures. Conclusion: The presented model allows performing extensive simulations of established treatment procedures for heart failure patients and evaluating new holistic methods of care and innovative study designs. This approach offers health care providers a unique, adaptable and comprehensive tool for decision making in the complex and socioeconomically challenging field of cardiovascular diseases. © 2019 The Author(s).",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-27 15:27:38,,,,1,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Hybrid; Discrete event; Agent based; Health economic modeling; Heart failure treatment model; Integrated care; Yes; Ues,0,1,1,0,None,0,AnyLogic,0,,,,,,Model and data available on request,,

Health economic evaluations frequently include projections for lifetime costs and health effects using modeling frameworks such as Markov modeling or discrete event simulation (DES). Markov models typically cannot represent events whose risk is determined by the length of time spent in state (sojourn time) without the use of tunnel states. DES is very flexible but introduces Monte Carlo variation, which can significantly limit the complexity of model analyses. Methods. We present a new methodological framework for health economic modeling that is based on, and extends, the concept of moment-generating functions (MGFs) for time-to-event random variables. When future costs and health effects are discounted, MGFs can be used to very efficiently calculate the total discounted life-years spent in a series of health states. Competing risks are incorporated into the method. This method can also be used to calculate discounted costs and health effects when these payoffs are constant per unit time, one-off, or exponential with regard to time. MGFs are extended to additionally support costs and health effects which are polynomial with regard to time (as in a commonly used model of population norms for EQ-5D utility). Worked Example. A worked example is used to demonstrate the application of the new method in practice and to compare it with Markov modeling and DES. Results are compared in terms of convergence and accuracy, and computation times are compared. R code and an Excel workbook are provided. Conclusions. The MGF method can be applied to health economic evaluations in the place of Markov modeling or DES and has certain advantages over both. © The Author(s) 2019.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-26 16:40:13,,523-539,,5,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; Markov model; cohort analysis; moment-generating function; semi-Markov model; Yes,0,1,0,1,None,0,R,1,,Github,,,,,MIT,MIT

The method is based on findings that a large percentage of patients are prescribed medications that are known to have pharmacogenetic associations, and over time, a substantial proportion are prescribed additional such medication. Preemptive genotyping facilitates genotype-guided therapy at the time medications are prescribed; panel-based testing allows providers to reuse previously collected genetic data when a new indication arises. Because it is cost-prohibitive to conduct panel-based genotyping on all patients, we describe a three-step approach to identify patients with the highest anticipated benefit. First, we construct prediction models to estimate the risk of being prescribed one of the target medications using readily available clinical data. Second, we use literature-based estimates of adverse event rates, variant allele frequencies, secular death rates, and costs to construct a discrete event simulation that estimates the expected benefit of having an individual’s genetic data in the electronic health record after an indication has occurred. Finally, we combine medication prescription risk with expected benefit of genotyping once a medication is indicated to calculate the expected benefit of preemptive genotyping. For each patient-clinic visit, we calculate this expected benefit across a range of medications and select patients with the highest expected benefit overall. We build a proof of concept implementation using a cohort of patients from a single academic medical center observed from July 2010 through December 2012. We then apply the results of our modeling strategy to show the extent to which we can improve clinical and economic outcomes in a cohort observed from January 2013 through December 2015. © The Author(s) 2019.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-26 16:39:47,,,,2,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,1,,,,discrete event simulation; precision medicine; electronic health records; pre-emptive genotyping; risk prediction; Yes,0,1,1,0,ISPOR,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,"cites previous work, can't find software in that either"

Bed management is a key to the effective delivery of high quality and low-cost healthcare. The purpose of this paper is to develop a discrete event simulation to assist in planning and staff scheduling decisions. Design/methodology/approach: A discrete event simulation model was developed for a hospital system to analyze admissions, patient transfer, length of stay (LOS), waiting time and queue time. The hospital system contained 50 beds and four departments. The data used to construct the model were from five years of patient records and contained information on 23,019 patients. Each department’s performance measures were taken into consideration separately to understand and quantify the behavior of departments individually, and the hospital system as a whole. Several scenarios were analyzed to determine the impact on reducing the number of patients waiting in queue, waiting time and LOS of patients. Findings: Using the simulation model, it was determined that reducing the bed turnover time by 1 h resulted in a statistically significant reduction in patient wait time in queue. Further, reducing the average LOS by 10 h results in statistically significant reductions in the average patient wait time and average patient queue. A comparative analysis of department also showed considerable improvements in average wait time, average number of patients in queue and average LOS with the addition of two beds. Originality/value: This research highlights the applicability of simulation in healthcare. Through data that are often readily available in bed management tracking systems, the operational behavior of a hospital can be modeled, which enables hospital management to test the impact of changes without cost and risk. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-26 16:39:40,,499-515,,2,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,1,,,,Discrete event simulation; Capacity management; Capacity planning; Bed management; Heathcare; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

This study proposes a three-stage solution framework to address this issue: Process Identification, Process Optimization, and Process Simulation. In the first, we use descriptive statistics to understand the data and obtain indicators as well as Process Mining techniques to identify the main process flow; the Optimization phase is composed of a mathematical model to provide an optimal physician schedule that reduces waiting times; and, finally, Simulation is performed to compare the original process flow and scheduling with the optimized solution. We applied the proposed solution framework to a case study in a Brazilian private hospital. Final data comprised of 65,407 emergency cases which corresponded to 399,631 event log registries in a 13-month period. The main metrics observed were the waiting time before the First General Assessment of a physician and the volume of patients within the system per hour and day of the week. When simulated, the optimal physician scheduling resulted in more than 40% reduction in waiting times and queue length, a 29.3% decrease of queue occurrences, and 54.2% less frequency of large queues. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-10-26 16:39:33,,,583,,362 LNBIP,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,1,,,,Emergency Department; Physician scheduling; Process discovery; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

According to several studies, the application of project risk management can reduce the incidence of DES project failure in health care however, far too little attention has been paid to this part. In this study, a risk management framework is provided for DES projects in health care order to reduce the occurrence of failure and increase the chance of success in the DES project. This work investigates both managerial and technical risks and tries to identify, evaluate, and control them by using a set of adopted methods. Emergency department seems to be the most popular area of DES projects in health care The proposed framework is applied to an emergency department that serves more than 23000 patients per year.

Therefore, healthcare professionals and managers have financial and workforce-related pressures. A decision support toolkit (DST) for improving the management and efficiency of COPD care is needed to respond to the needs of patients now and in the future. In collaboration with the COPD team of a hospital and community service in London, we conceptualised the pathway for COPD patients and developed a discrete event simulation model (DES) incorporating the dynamics of patient readmissions. A DES model or operational model at this scale has never been previously developed, despite many studies using other modelling and simulation techniques in COPD. Our model is the first of its kind to include COPD readmissions as well as assessing the quantifiable impact of re-designing COPD services. We demonstrate the impact of post-exacerbation pulmonary rehabilitation (PEPR) policy and observe that PEPR would be cost-effective with improvements in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), reduction in emergency readmissions and occupied bed days. The DST improves the understanding of the impact of scenarios (activities, resources, financial implications etc.) for key decision makers and supports commissioners in implementing the interventions. © Operational Research Society 2020.",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:48:19,,754-778,,4,73,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; COPD; decision support toolkit; Patient flow modelling; readmission; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Simul8,0,,,,,,,,

We propose a lean approach based on the pull-strategy “Constant Work in Process” (ConWIP) to develop robust and easy-to-implement AS rules. Our objective is to reduce patients’ waiting time and maximise the use rate of resources while considering the global surgical process and stochastic service times. The AS rules based on ConWIP are evaluated using a Discrete-Event-Simulation model. Numerical experiments based on a real-life case study are carried out to assess the proposed appointment rules’ performance and compare them to AS rules developed in the literature.

In solid tumor oncology studies, analyses of endpoints such as progression-free survival (PFS) are based on progression events detected by imaging assessments. This study aimed to evaluate the potential bias introduced by differential imaging assessment frequency when using electronic health record (EHR)-derived data to investigate the comparative effectiveness of cancer therapies. Methods: Using a nationwide de-identified EHR-derived database, we first analyzed imaging assessment frequency patterns in patients diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC). We used those RWD inputs to develop a discrete event simulation model of two treatments where disease progression was the outcome and PFS was the endpoint. Using this model, we induced bias with differential imaging assessment timing and quantified its effect on observed versus true treatment effectiveness. We assessed percent bias in the estimated hazard ratio (HR). Results: The frequency of assessments differed by cancer treatment types. In simulated comparative-effectiveness studies, PFS HRs estimated using real-world imaging assessment frequencies differed from the true HR by less than 10% in all scenarios (range: 0.4% to −9.6%). The greatest risk of biased effect estimates was found comparing treatments with widely different imaging frequencies, most exaggerated in disease settings where time to progression is very short. Conclusions: This study provided evidence that the frequency of imaging assessments to detect disease progression can differ by treatment type in real-world patients with cancer and may induce some bias in comparative-effectiveness studies in some situations. © 2021 Flatiron Health Inc.

Cost-effectiveness analysis often applies averages from populations, which disregards patient heterogeneity even though there are a range of methods available to acknowledge patient heterogeneity. This review evaluates existing economic evaluations of interventions in schizophrenia to understand how patient heterogeneity is currently reflected in economic evaluation. Methods: Electronic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO via Ovid and the Health Technology Assessment database were run to identify full economic evaluations of interventions aiming to reduce the symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Two levels of screening were used, and explicit inclusion criteria were applied. Prespecified data extraction and critical appraisal were performed. Results: Seventy-six relevant studies were identified. More than half (41 of 76) of the articles acknowledged patient heterogeneity in some way through discussion or methods. There was a range of patient characteristics considered, including demographics and socioeconomic factors (eg, age, educational level, ethnicity), clinical characteristics (eg, symptom severity, comorbidities), and preferences (eg, preferences related to outcomes or symptoms). Subgroup analyses were rarely reported (8 of 76). Conclusions: Patient heterogeneity was frequently mentioned in studies but was rarely thoroughly investigated in the identified economic evaluations. When investigated, included patient characteristics and methods were found to be heterogeneous. Understanding and acknowledging patient heterogeneity may alter the conclusions of cost-effectiveness evaluations; subsequently, we would encourage further research in this area. © 2021 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, Inc.

Materials and methods: CT exams were divided into stages, measured during on-site surveys at CT services in small and average size private hospitals. Ten devices in nine health units, five cities and two states of Brazil were studied to this end, and the following data were collected: Time spent in each stage for each type of exam; average monthly number of exams performed and general characteristics of exams. Three arrival rates were defined (103, 154 and 206 patients/day), representing expected demand for the studied units. From these parameters, six scenarios were simulated, consisting of changes in personnel and hospital structure (e.g., ‘adding a changing room’) in a base scenario (one CT, one changing room, no nursing assistance, arrival rate 1). Results: It was possible to identify a scenario most useful for very large demands, such as large emergency hospitals in big cities, (a CT, nursing assistance and three changing rooms added to the base scenario). Another identified scenario was more adequate for small demands (adding a changing room to the base scenario). Conclusion: Administrative/organizational measures are a very important factor in defining productivity in a hospital imaging sector. The focus of these measures should be on detecting bottlenecks and improving processes, regardless of the type of equipment used. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:43:08,,536-542,,1,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,MedModel,0,,,,,,,,

Methods: We developed a conceptual model of BHC patient flow through the ED, incorporating anticipated system changes with both universal suicide risk screening scenarios. Retrospective site-specific patient tracking data from 2017 were used to generate model parameters and validate model output metrics with a random 50/50 split for derivation and validation data. Results: The model predicted small increases (less than 1 hour) in LOS and wait times for our BHC patients in both universal screening scenarios. However, the days per year in which the ED experienced secure unit overflow increased (existing system: 52.9 days; 95% CI, 51.5–54.3 days; ED: 94.4 days; 95% CI, 92.6–96.2 days; and hospital-wide: 276.9 days; 95% CI, 274.8–279.0 days). Conclusions: The DES model predicted that implementation of either universal suicide risk screening scenario would not severely impact LOS or wait times for BHC patients in our ED. However, universal screening would greatly stress our existing ED capacity to care for BHC patients in secure, dedicated patient areas by creating more overflow. @ 2022 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:46:48,,25-34,,1,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Computer simulation; Emergency department; Length of stay; Mental health; Suicide; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Simio,0,,,,,,,,

The Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) 2.0 model was adapted to conceptualise the current ICU system. A hybrid simulation model was developed to characterise major care delivery processes as discrete-time events, feature patients, clinicians, and other artifacts as autonomous agents, and integrate them in the same simulation environment to capture their interactions under a variety of ICU production conditions. Electronic health record (EHR) data from a medical ICU of Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota, were used to calibrate model parameters. Upon iterative refinement and validation, the model has the potential to be integrated with the hospital information system to simulate real-life events as a full-fledged digital twin of the system. It can be used as an in-silico testbed to investigate the real-time allocation of ICU resources such as medical equipment, flexible staffing, workflow change, and support decisions of patient admission, discharge, and transfer, for healthcare delivery innovation.

This is illustrated well in the context of healthcare, particularly in an emergency department, where hard resource constraints and vague decision-making from large datasets, means neither approach sufficiently captures the entire picture of patient care. A hybrid approach may see simulation models providing details of paths that patients follow through processing, which covers associated resource utilization, and AI/ML models providing deeper insight into the treatment details of patients and their associated experiences. This paper provides a taxonomy and architecture for combining simulation models and AI/ML models.

Methods: A discrete event simulation model was created to evaluate CT access time for emergency department (ED) patients at a large academic medical center with six unique CT machines that serve unscheduled emergency, semi-scheduled inpatient, and scheduled outpatient demand. Three operational interventions were tested: adding additional patient transporters, using an alternative creatinine lab, and adding a registered nurse dedicated to monitoring CT patients in the ED. Results: All interventions improved access times. Adding one or two transporters improved ED access times by up to 9.8 minutes (Mann-Whitney (MW) CI: [−11.0,−8.7]) and 10.3 minutes (MW CI [−11.5, −9.2]). The alternative creatinine and RN interventions provided 3-minute (MW CI: [−4.0, −2.0]) and 8.5-minute (MW CI: [−9.7, −8.3]) improvements.

The addition of monoclonal antibody (mAb) infusions, which prevent severe disease and reduce hospitalizations, to the repertoire of COVID-19 countermeasures offers the opportunity to reduce system stress but requires strategic planning and use of novel approaches. Our objective was to develop a web-based decision-support tool to help existing and future mAb infusion facilities make better and more informed staffing and capacity decisions. Materials and Methods: Using real-world observations from three medical centers operating with federal field team support, we developed a discrete-event simulation model and performed simulation experiments to assess performance of mAb infusion sites under different conditions. Results: 162,000 scenarios were evaluated by simulations. Our analyses revealed that it was more effective to add check-in staff than to add additional nurses for middle-to-large size sites with ≥2 infusion nurses; that scheduled appointments performed better than walk-ins when patient load was not high; and that reducing infusion time was particularly impactful when load on resources was only slightly above manageable levels. Discussion: Physical capacity, check-in staff, and infusion time were as important as nurses for mAb sites. Health systems can effectively operate an infusion center under different conditions to provide mAb therapeutics even with relatively low investments in physical resources and staff. Conclusion: Simulations of mAb infusion sites were used to create a capacity planning tool to optimize resource utility and allocation in constrained pandemic conditions, and more efficiently treat COVID-19 patients at existing and future mAb infusion sites.

In this field, some solutions have to be adapted to patients. This is especially true for dentistry, where all the patients have their own unique mouth and tooth structure. It is now possible to provide an accurate model of the patient's mouth and teeth with solutions that are perfectly compatible with them, leading to the provision of a dental service with a high success rate. Even if there is a problem, it is enough to change the three-dimensional design. Therefore, it is a time-saving method, too. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of 3DP in dentistry and to identify the processes and procedures resulting from the use of this technology. To do so, with the help of a case study, a 3DP-based dental clinic that provides implant, orthodontics, restoration and dentures services is simulated in Arena software. The current state of the system is assessed by defining appropriate evaluation criteria including net profit, utilization, waiting time, patients makespan and laboratory makespan. The simulation model is then developed with innovations such as adding an inventory control policy, creating rest time for resources and controlling the policy of sending products from laboratory to the clinic. After an extensive sensitivity analysis, improving the performance of the system is on the agenda of this paper by examining various scenarios. Results show that scenarios such as reducing some resources of the system or considering rest time in exchange for increasing the duration of the work shift can have a significant impact on clinic performance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 11:30:27,,2949-2979,,9-10,118,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Healthcare; 3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Dental clinic; Simulation method; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

Methods: A discrete event simulation model was built in R considering the risk of cardiovascular events (heart failure, stroke, coronary heart disease, and diabetes) associated with BMI categories in the Spanish population. The main parameters included in the model were estimated from Spanish hospital discharge records and the Spanish Health Survey and allowed both first-order and second-order (probabilistic sensitivity analysis) uncertainty to be programmed into the model. The simulation yielded the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular events as validation outputs. To illustrate the capacity of the model, we estimated the reduction in cardiovascular events and cost-utility (incremental cost/incremental quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) of a hypothetical intervention that fully eliminated the cardiovascular risks associated with obesity and overweight. Results: The Validation Status of Health-Economic decision models (AdViSHE) tool was applied. Internal validation plots showed adequate goodness of fit for the Spanish population. External validation was achieved by comparing the simulated and real incidence by age group for stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and heart failure. The intervention reduced the population hazard ratios of stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and heart failure to 0.81, 0.74, and 0.78, respectively, and added 0.74 QALYs to the whole population. Conclusions: This obesity simulation model evidenced good properties for estimating the long-term epidemiological and economic impact of policies to tackle obesity in Spain. The conceptual model could be implemented for other counties using country-specific input data. © The Author(s) 2021.",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:42:16,,241-254,,2,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,stroke; economics; acute myocardial infarction; cardiovascular risk; diabetes mellitus; incidence; obesity; Yes,0,1,1,0,ISPOR,0,R,1,,,,,,,,

Materials and Methods: Study data was derived from the data warehouse and domain knowledge on the operational process of the largest tertiary hospital in Singapore. 34,025 unique cases over 43 operating rooms (ORs) and 18 surgical disciplines performed from 1 January 2019 to 31 May 2020 were extracted for the study. A clustering approach was used in stage 1 of the modelling framework to develop the groups of surgeries that followed distinctive postponement patterns. These clusters were then used as inputs for stage 2 where the DES model was used to evaluate alternative phased resumption strategies considering the outcomes of OR utilization, waiting times to surgeries and the time to clear the backlogs. Results: The tool enabled us to understand the elective postponement patterns during the COVID-19 partial lockdown period, and evaluate the best phased resumption strategy. Differences in the performance measures were evaluated based on 95% confidence intervals. The results indicate that two of the gradual phased resumption strategies provided lower peak OR and bed utilizations but required a longer time to return to BAU levels. Minimum peak bed demands could also be reduced by approximately 14 beds daily with the gradual resumption strategy, whilst the maximum peak bed demands by approximately 8.2 beds. Peak OR utilization could be reduced to 92% for gradual resumption as compared to a minimum peak of 94.2% with the full resumption strategy. Conclusions: The 2-stage modelling framework coupled with a user-friendly visualization interface were key enablers for understanding the elective surgery postponement patterns during a partial lockdown phase. The DES model enabled the identification and evaluation of optimal phased resumption policies across multiple important operational outcome measures. Lay abstract: During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, most healthcare systems suspended their non-urgent elective surgery services. This strategy was undertaken as a means to expand surge capacity, through the preservation of structural resources (such as operating theaters, ICU beds, and ventilators), consumables (such as personal protective equipment and medications), and critical healthcare manpower. As a result, some patients had less-essential surgeries postponed due to the pandemic. As the first wave of the pandemic waned, there was an urgent need to quickly develop optimal strategies for the resumption of these surgeries. We developed a 2-stage discrete events simulation (DES) framework based on 34,025 unique cases over 43 operating rooms (ORs) and 18 surgical disciplines performed from 1 January 2019 to 31 May 2020 captured in the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) enterprise data warehouse. The outcomes evaluated were OR utilization, waiting times to surgeries and time to clear the backlogs. A user-friendly visualization interface was developed to enable decision makers to determine the most promising surgery resumption strategy across these outcomes. Hospitals globally can make use of the modelling framework to adapt to their own surgical systems to evaluate strategies for postponement and resumption of elective surgeries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:55:30,,,,,158,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,COVID-19; Discrete events simulation; Agile resource planning; Healthcare resource allocation; OR resource management; Yes,0,1,1,0,,1,Python,1,,,,,,Data and results,,Updated data and model results are available on http://hi-board.ap-southeast-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/.

This study aims to evaluate the effects of changing consultation start time and patient arrival on wait times and crowding in an outpatient clinic with a dual practice system. A discrete event simulation (DES) model was developed based on real-world data from an Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) clinic in a public hospital. Data on patient flow, resource availability, and time taken for registration and clinic processes for public and private patients were sourced from stakeholder discussion and time-motion study (TMS), while arrival times were sourced from the hospital’s information system database. Probability distributions were used to fit these input data in the model. Scenario analyses involved configurations on consultation start time/staggered patient arrival. The median registration and clinic turnaround times (TT) were significantly different between public and private patients (p < 0.01). Public patients have longer wait times than private patients in this study’s dual practice setting. Scenario analyses showed that early consultation start time that matches patient arrival time and staggered arrival could reduce the overall TT for public and private patients by 40% and 21%, respectively. Similarly, the number of patients waiting at the clinic per hour could be reduced by 10–21% during clinic peak hours. Matching consultation start time with staggered patient arrival can potentially reduce wait times and crowding, especially for public patients, without incurring additional resource needs and help narrow the wait time gap between public and private patients. Healthcare managers and policymakers can consider simulation approaches for the monitoring and improvement of healthcare operational efficiency to meet rising healthcare demand and costs. © 2022 by the authors.

In this study, correlations between performance measures are taken into consideration using modified TOPSIS. A framework is developed in which DES is used to model multiple experiments and factor levels to estimate various performance measures. Design of experiments is used to study the effects of factors and their interactions. Experiments are input to modified TOPSIS as alternatives to be compared based on multiple correlated performance measures. A case study is presented at Educational Dentistry Clinics in Jordan. This study was designed to improve overall clinic performance. Results show that when using appropriate appointment scheduling rules and orthodontist working schedules, and exploiting the resources effectively, the best scenario obtained shows an effective decrease in orthodontic patient waiting times and length of stay (LOS), and primary diagnosis patients LOS by 29.44%, 37.74% and 7.12%, respectively. It also shows an increase in orthodontist and receptionist utilizations, and number of patients served by 11.22%, 65.82% and 69.39%, respectively. The results obtained from modified TOPSIS were more accurate as compared to traditional TOPSIS. As a future work, other appointment rules can be tested and other MCDM techniques that take criteria correlations into consideration can be used to rank the experiments such as the analytic network process. © 2021, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 11:44:15,,3707-3724,,3,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; Healthcare systems; Design of experiments; Dental Clinics; Modified TOPSIS; Yes,0,1,1,0,ISPOR,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

Many existing standard models are based on simplifying assumptions, including site independency and a similar system-wide busyness of ambulances. In practice, when a site is busy, a call is forwarded to another site. Thus, the busyness of each site depends not only on the rate of calls in the surrounding area, but also on interactions with other facilities. If the demand varies across the urban area, assuming an average system-wide server busy fraction may lead to an overestimation of the actual coverage. We show that site interdependencies can be integrated into the well-known Maximum Expected Covering Location Problem (MEXCLP) by introducing an upper bound for the busyness of each site. We apply our new mathematical formulation to the case of a local EMS provider. To evaluate the solution quality, we use a discrete event simulation based on anonymized real-world call data. Results of our simulation-optimization approach indicate that the coverage can be improved in most cases by taking site interdependencies into account, leading to an improved ambulance allocation and a faster emergency care. © 2021, The Author(s).",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:44:08,,42-62,,1,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Operations Research; Busy fraction; Emergency medical services; Facility location; Site interdependency; Yes,0,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,methodological paper

A direct consequence of overcrowding is a long wait for visit and treatment of people who require primary care, possibly endangering the lives of critical patients. Healthcare management literature devoted to analyze ED operational policies is very wide, and many approaches have been proposed to address this important problem. However, less attention has been given to patient peak arrivals caused by the occurrence of some critical events which can strongly strain the operational efficiency of an ED. In this paper, we consider the particular case study of a medium-size ED located in a region of Central Italy recently hit by a severe earthquake, aiming at assessing the effects of such an occurrence on the ED operation. In particular, we propose a discrete event simulation (DES) model to analyze the patient flows through this ED, simulating unusual operational conditions due to a critical event, like a natural disaster, which causes a sudden spike in the number of patient arrivals. The availability of detailed data concerning the ED processes enabled building an accurate DES model and performing extensive scenario analyses. The model provides a valid decision support system for the ED managers in assessing specific emergency plans to be activated in case of mass casualty disasters. © The Author(s) 2021.",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:43:51,,161-181,,3,98,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; patient flow; Emergency department; overcrowding; patient peak arrivals; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

Our PHC simulation models incorporate four types of patients seeking medical care: outpatients, inpatients, childbirth cases, and patients seeking antenatal care. A generic modeling approach was adopted to develop simulation models of PHC operations. This involved developing an archetype PHC simulation, which was then adapted to represent two other PHC configurations, differing in numbers of resources and types of services provided, encountered during PHC visits. A model representing a benchmark configuration conforming to government-mandated operational guidelines, with demand estimated from disease burden data and service times closer to international estimates (higher than observed), was also developed. Simulation outcomes for the three observed configurations indicate negligible patient waiting times and low resource utilization values at observed patient demand estimates. However, simulation outcomes for the benchmark configuration indicated significantly higher resource utilization. Simulation experiments to evaluate the effect of potential changes in operational patterns on reducing the utilization of stressed resources for the benchmark case were performed. Our analysis also motivated the development of simple analytical approximations of the average utilization of a server in a queueing system with characteristics similar to the PHC doctor/patient system. Our study represents the first step in an ongoing effort to establish the computational infrastructure required to analyze public health operations in India and can provide researchers in other settings with hierarchical health systems, a template for the development of simulation models of their primary healthcare facilities. © The Author(s) 2021.",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:59:24,,183-208,,3,98,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete-event simulation; healthcare simulation; primary health center operations; public healthcare delivery; Yes,0,1,1,1,None,0,Salabim,1,,Github,,,,,,no license

Given its purpose as a short-term forecasting tool, the simulation model requires an accurate representation of the current system state and high fidelity in mimicking the system dynamics from that state. The two main components of the simulation model are the stochastic modeling of patient admission and patient flow processes. The patient arrival process is modelled using a Gompertz growth model, which enables the representation of the exponential growth caused by the initial spread of the virus, followed by a period of maximum arrival rate and then a decreasing phase until the wave subsides. We conducted an empirical study concluding that the Gompertz model provides a better fit to pandemic-related data (positive cases and hospitalization numbers) and has superior prediction capacity than other sigmoid models based on Richards, Logistic, and Stannard functions. Patient flow modelling considers different pathways and dynamic length of stay estimation in several healthcare stages using patient-level data. We report on the application of the simulation model in two Autonomous Regions of Spain (Navarre and La Rioja) during the two COVID-19 waves experienced in 2020.

In the proposed framework, patients with cancer receive at least two lines of therapy (LOTs) followed by palliative care throughout their lifetime. Patients cycle through progression-free and progressive disease health states in each LOT before death. Under this framework, four broad aspects of modeling effectiveness of treatment sequences need exploration. First, disease progression, treatment discontinuation, and the relationship between the two events should be considered. Second, the effectiveness of each LOT depends on its placement in a treatment sequence as the effectiveness of later LOTs may be influenced by the earlier LOTs. Third, the treatment-free interval (TFI; time between discontinuation of earlier LOT and initiation of later LOT) may impact a therapy’s effectiveness. Fourth, in the absence of head-to-head trials directly comparing LOTs, indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of outcomes for a specific LOT or even for the entire treatment sequence is important to consider. A search of decision models that estimated effectiveness of at least two lines of oncology therapy was conducted in PubMed (N = 20) and technology appraisals by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (N = 26) to assess four methodological aspects related to the model framework: (1) selection of outcomes for effectiveness in a treatment sequence, (2) approaches to adjust the efficacy of a treatment in consideration of its place in the sequence, (3) approaches to address TFIs between LOTs, and (4) incorporation of ITCs to estimate comparators’ effectiveness in the absence of direct head-to-head evidence. Most models defined health states based on disease progression on different LOTs while estimating treatment duration outside of the main model framework (30/46) and used data from multiple data sources in different LOTs to model efficacy of a treatment sequence (41/46). No models adjusted efficacy for the characteristics of patients who switched from an earlier LOT to a later LOT or adjusted for the impact of prior therapies, and just six models considered TFIs. While 11 models applied ITC results to estimate efficacy in comparator treatment sequences, the majority limited the ITC to one LOT in the sequence. Thus, there is substantial room to improve the estimation of effectiveness for treatment sequences using existing data when comparing effectiveness of alternative treatment sequences. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:29:58,,257-268,,3,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Yes,0,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,lit review

Conventional health centers, such as hospitals and emergency departments have been registering an increase in demand and atypical patterns due to the high transmissibility of the virus. In this context, the adoption of Temporary Hospitals (THs) is effective in trying to relieve conventional hospitals and direct efforts in the treatment of suspected and positive patients for COVID-19. However, some requirements should be considered regarding the processes performed by THs to maintain the health and safety of patients and staff. Based on the literature, we evaluated aspects related to patient safety in THs, especially linked to biosafety of medical facilities, and patient transport and visit. We highlight the analysis of flows and layouts, hospital cleaning and patient care. We described two case studies to demonstrate the proposed approach. As result, simulation tests improved safety metrics, such as waiting time for procedures, movement intensity in each area, length of stay and TH capacity. We conclude that the approach allows us to provide better THs that prevent cross-contamination, provide suitable care, and meet the demand. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:57:32,,,,,147,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,COVID-19; Discrete event simulation; Safety assessment; Temporary hospital; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,1,Flexsim,0,,,,,,,,

These procedural changes are included in emergency plans that hospitals are required to define. Nonetheless, procedures followed in emergency situations may not always be consistent with those planned during “peace time”, and their effectiveness is tested only in case of a disaster. For these reasons, defining a model that simulates the patient flow through the hospital would prove crucial to preventively test the response capacity in case of a disaster. In this paper, the analysis of different emergency plans, interviews with healthcare professionals and an extensive literature review are used to derive two Discrete-Event Simulation models of a hospital digital twin, representing operations in routine and post-earthquake conditions. The two models are defined by balancing the need to represent a complex system with sufficient accuracy, the limitations posed by data availability and the multiplicity of outcomes of a patient treatment. The models are general in their definition, and their potentiality is shown through the application to a reference case study representative of a small hospital in Central Italy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 11:34:19,,,,,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Hospital; Discrete-Event Simulation; Earthquakes; Emergency plans; Patient flow model; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Matlab,0,,,,,,,,

Since capacity of e.g. ICUs is highly restricted, this bottleneck plays an important role in the management of an efficient flow of surgical patients through the system. This paper aims to provide hospital decision makers with easy-to-follow guidelines for the daily patient scheduling decisions and presents a novel chance-constraint optimisation model to develop efficient admission templates for elective surgeries on a tactical level. With a given patient mix, we decide on the number of surgeries that can realistically be treated during a typical week, with respect to limited resources of OR and ICU and considering stochastic demand. The benefit of such templates is exemplified using a dedicated simulation model in a realistic case study. The simulation model rebuilds daily operations in OR and ICU and allows to mimic typical decision making in OR and ICU. Computational studies show that continually applying such templates as admission guidelines leads to a well-utilised OR and efficiently used ICUs. The extensive simulation studies confirm that the template plans obtained from the chance-constraint optimisation model can provide guidance for an operating room planner. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 14:07:46,,243-260,,1,298,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete-event simulation; OR in health services; Chance-constraint optimisation model; Intensive care unit; Operating room; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Simul8,0,,,,,,,,

Background: Within health systems, changes in health care resources can be very costly, especially if these changes are long-term. The discrete-event simulation method described in this paper allows for the monitoring and analysis of complicated changes in real systems by using computer-based modelling. Method: The discrete event simulation model was derived from nine scenarios according to the number of nurses and doctors, and a comparison was made between the results of the scenarios and the actual results. Results: Among the scenarios, scenario 6 provided the lowest treatment cost for a patient by employing three doctors and two nurses with the best performance. The cost of treatment for a patient varies between ŧ9.00 and ŧ11.00 depending on the value of δ, and the daily cost of these resources to the hospital is ŧ1300.77. Conclusions: This study provides a clear picture of a cost analysis comparison based on changes made about the actual health system in the computer-based simulated environment.

The first and most important step is to identify the patient flow through a certain process. For the second step, there is a crucial need for predicting the future patient arrivals for planning especially at the administrative level of a hospital. This study aims to first simulate the patient flow process and then predict the future entry of patients in a hospital as the case study. Also, according to the system status, this study suggests some policies based on different probable scenarios and assesses the outcome of each decision to improve the policies. The simulation model is conducted by Arena.15 software. The seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model is used for patient’s arrival prediction within 30 days. Different scenarios are evaluated through a data envelopment analysis (DEA) method. The simulation model runs for predicted patient’s arrival for the least efficient scenario and the outputs compare the base run scenario. Results show that the system collapses after 14 days according to the predictions and simulation and the bottleneck of the ICU and CCU departments becomes problematic. Hospitals can use simulation and also prediction tools to avoid the crisis to plan for the future in the pandemic.

Previous studies usually investigated how to improve the treatment flow in order to reduce patient waiting time or length of stay. The studies on blood collection counters have received less attention. Therefore, the objective of this study is to reduce the patient waiting time at outpatient clinics for metabolism and nephrology outpatients. A discrete-event simulation is used to analyze the four different strategies for blood collection counter resource allocation. Through analyzing four different strategic settings, the experimental results revealed that the maximum number of patients waiting before the outpatient clinics was reduced from 41 to 33 (20%); the maximum patient waiti-ng time at the outpatient clinics was decreased from 201.6 minutes to 83 minutes (59%). In this study, we found that adjusting the settings of blood collection counters would be beneficial. Assigning one exclusive blood collection counter from 8 to 10 am is the most suitable option with the least impact on the operational process for hospital staff. The results provide managerial insight regarding the cost-effective strategy selection for the hospital operational strategy. © The Author(s) 2022.",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:44:57,,,,,59,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,simulation; waiting time; process improvement; outpatient clinics; patient flows; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Simul8,0,,,,,,,,

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) on cell-free DNA (cfDNA) might be an attractive alternative. We evaluated the costs, throughput time, and diagnostic yield of two diagnostic scenarios with tissue and cfDNA for mNSCLC patients, compared to diagnostics based on tissue biopsy alone. Data were retrieved from 209 stage IV NSCLC patients included in 10 hospitals in the Netherlands in the observational Lung cancer Early Molecular Assessment (LEMA) trial. Discrete event simulation was developed to compare three scenarios, using LEMA data as input where possible: (1) diagnostics with “tissue only”; (2) diagnostics with “cfDNA first”, and subsequent tissue biopsy if required (negative for EGFR, BRAF ALK, ROS1); (3) cfDNA if tissue biopsy failed (“tissue first”). Scenario-and probabilistic analyses were performed to quantify uncertainty. In scenario 1, 84% (Credibility Interval [CrI] 70–94%) of the cases had a clinically relevant test result, compared to 93% (CrI 86–98%) in scenario 2, and 93% (CrI 86–99%) in scenario 3. The mean throughput time was 20 days (CrI 17–23) pp in scenario 1, 9 days (CrI 7–11) in scenario 2, and 19 days (CrI 16–22) in scenario 3. Mean costs were €2304 pp (CrI €2067–2507) in scenario 1, compared to €3218 (CrI €3071–3396) for scenario 2, and €2448 (CrI €2382–2506) for scenario 3. Scenarios 2 and 3 led to a reduction in tissue biopsies of 16% and 9%, respectively.

Objective: Based on the data from the Medical Emergency System of Bogotá, Colombia, we first sought to characterize the prehospital re- sponse in cardiac arrest and determine with the model which is the least number of resources necessary to respond within eight minutes, taking into account their location, number, and type. Methods: A database of incidents reported in administrative records of the district health authority of Bogotá (2014 to 2017) was obtained. Based on this information, a hybrid model based on discrete event simulation and genetic algorithms was designed to establish the amount, type and geographic location of resources according to the frequencies and typology of the events. Results: From the database, Bogotá presented 938 671 ambulances dispatches in the period. 47.4% high priority, 18.9% medium and 33.74% low. 92% of these corresponded to 15 of 43 medical emergency codes. The response times recorded were longer than expected, especially in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (median 19 minutes).

Objective: This study evaluates the use of teleconsultations (TCs) for specialist consultations at hospitals in terms of costs, resource consumption, and patient travel time. The key feature of our evaluation framework is the combination of an economic evaluation through a cost analysis and a performance evaluation through a discrete-event simulation (DES) approach. Methods: Three data sets were used to obtain detailed information on the characteristics of patients, characteristics of patients' residential locations, and usage of telehealth stations. A total of 532 patients who received at least one TC and 18,559 patients who received solely physical consultations (CSs) were included in the initial sample. The TC patients were recruited during a 7-month period (ie, 2020 data) versus 19 months for the CS patients (ie, 2019 and 2020 data). A propensity score matching procedure was applied in the economic evaluation. To identify the best scenarios for reaping the full benefits of TCs, various scenarios depicting different population types and deployment strategies were explored in the DES model. Associated break-even levels were calculated. Results: The results of the cost evaluation reveal a higher cost for the TC group, mainly induced by higher volumes of (tele)consultations per patient and the substantial initial investment required for TC equipment. On average, the total cost per patient over 298 days of follow-up was €356.37 (US $392) per TC patient and €305.18 (US $336) per CS patient. However, the incremental cost of TCs was not statistically significant: €356.37 - €305.18 = €51.19 or US $392 - US $336 = US $56 (95% CI -35.99 to 114.25; P=.18). Sensitivity analysis suggested heterogeneous economic profitability levels within subpopulations and based on the intensity of use of TC solutions. In fact, the DES model results show that TCs could be a cost-saving strategy in some cases, depending on population characteristics, the amortization speed of telehealth equipment, and the locations of telehealth stations. Conclusions: The use of TCs has the potential to lead to a major organizational change in the health care system in the near future. Nevertheless, TC performance is strongly related to the context and deployment strategy involved. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Methods: The OPD process & workflow as per the expected load at tertiary care cancer hospital were finalized with various stakeholders in a focused group discussion. The finalized OPD process & workflow along with the OPD Building plans were utilized to develop a discrete event simulation model for the OPD at a tertiary care cancer hospital using a discrete event simulator. The simulation model thus developed was tested with incremental patient loads in 5 different scenarios/“What if” situations (Scenario 1–5). The data regarding initial patient load and resources deployed was taken from on-ground observations at the tertiary care cancer hospital. Results: It was found that rooms and doctors were over-utilized and support staff utilization remained low. This was implemented with a lesser waiting time for patients. No additional support staff was provided thus improving utilization of existing staff and saving on resources. The simulations enabled us to deploy resources just when it was required, which ensured optimal utilization and better efficiency. The peak census helped us to determine the capacity of the waiting area in different scenarios with incremental patient load and resource deployment. Conclusion: The simulation software was very helpful, as “what if scenarios” could be created and the system tested, without disturbing the normal functioning of OPD. This enabled decision-making before making on-ground changes which saved a lot of time and money. Also, the processes of the old system were reengineered to fit the needs of changing times. © 2022 The Authors.

METHODS AND RESULTS : A discrete-event simulation model was developed from a societal perspective of a low-risk (Germany) and a high-risk (Kazakhstan) country. The model compared a Screen&Prevent strategy guided by hsTnI against a do-nothing strategy. Risk functions were derived from published data of a prospective cohort study [Nord-Trøndelag Health (HUNT) Study]. The model assessed the number of CVD events and deaths, healthy life years, direct and indirect costs in PPP 2018 Dollar, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) over a time horizon of 10 years. Screen&Prevent reduced the number of CVD events per 1000 subjects by 5.1 and 5.0, equal to a number-needed-to-screen of 195 and 191 in Kazakhstan and Germany. Screen&Prevent was cost saving in Kazakhstan and cost-effective in Germany with an incremental-cost-effectiveness ratio of $6755 ($2294; $24 054) per QALY gained at an opportunity-cost based willingness-to-pay threshold of $27 373. Varying input variables in univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the analysis. CONCLUSION : Assessing the cardiovascular risk with hsTnI in a general population and subsequently referring those at high risk to preventive means would very likely be cost-effective or cost-saving by avoiding CVD events and associated direct and indirect costs. This conclusion is retained even if only the direct costs or only the costs for screening and prevention are considered. Future studies should evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of hsTnI-guided assessment strategies against established risk algorithms. © The Author(s) 2021.

Despite the expanding clinical literature, there is a significant paucity of health economics evidence to inform the prioritization and implementation of genomic sequencing. This study aims to evaluate whether genomic sequencing for pediatric-onset mitochondrial disorders (MDs) is cost-effective and cost-beneficial relative to conventional care from an Australian healthcare system perspective. Two independent and complementary health economic modeling approaches were used. Approach 1 used a decision tree to model the costs and outcomes associated with genomic sequencing and conventional care. Approach 2 used a discrete-event simulation to incorporate heterogeneity in the condition and clinical practice. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Genomic sequencing was less costly and more effective compared with conventional care, saving AU$1997 (Approach 1) to AU$8823 (Approach 2) per child tested, while leading to an additional 11 (Approach 1) to 14 (Approach 2) definitive diagnoses per 100 children tested. The mean monetary value of the incremental benefits of genomic sequencing was estimated at AU$5890 (95% CI: AU$5730−$6046). Implementation of genomic sequencing for MDs in Australia could translate to an annual cost-saving of up to AU$0.7 million. Genomic sequencing is cost-saving relative to traditional investigative approaches, while enabling more diagnoses to be made in a timely manner, offering substantial personal benefits to children and their families. Our findings support the prioritization of genomic sequencing for children with MDs. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Society of Human Genetics.",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:45:10,,577-586,,5,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Yes,0,1,1,0,ISPOR,0,TreeAge,0,,,,,,,,

Improvement is complex, given the interaction of multiple people, processes and institutions. We aimed to develop a mixed-method approach to understand the TBI pathway based on the lived experience of local people, supported by quantitative methodologies and to determine potential improvement targets. DESIGN: We describe a systems approach based on narrative exploration, participatory diagramming, data collection and discrete event simulation (DES), conducted by an international research collaborative. SETTING: The study is set in the tertiary neurotrauma centre in Yangon General Hospital, Myanmar, in 2019-2020 (prior to the SARS-CoV2 pandemic). PARTICIPANTS: The qualitative work involved 40 workshop participants and 64 interviewees to explore the views of a wide range of stakeholders including staff, patients and relatives. The 1-month retrospective admission snapshot covered 85 surgical neurotrauma admissions. RESULTS: The TBI pathway was outlined, with system boundaries defined around the management of TBI once admitted to the neurosurgical unit. Retrospective data showed 18% mortality, 71% discharge to home and an 11% referral rate. DES was used to investigate the system, showing its vulnerability to small surges in patient numbers, with critical points being CT scanning and observation ward beds. This explorative model indicated that a modest expansion of observation ward beds to 30 would remove the flow-limitations and indicated possible consequences of changes. CONCLUSIONS: A systems approach to improving TBI care in resource-poor settings may be supported by simulation and informed by qualitative work to ground it in the direct experience of those involved. Narrative interviews, participatory diagramming and DES represent one possible suite of methods deliverable within an international partnership. Findings can support targeted improvement investments despite coexisting resource limitations while indicating concomitant risks. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Among patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular (CV) disease enrolled in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01131676), empagliflozin added to standard of care (SOC) reduced the risk of incident or worsening nephropathy compared with SOC alone. This analysis evaluated the cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin versus SOC alone in the subpopulation with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) from the perspective of US commercial insurers and Medicare. Study Design: Discrete event simulation model. Setting &amp; Population: Patients with DKD in a US health care system. Interventions: Empagliflozin 10 or 25 mg with SOC versus SOC alone. SOC included glucose-lowering therapies and medications to treat CV risk factors. Outcomes: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (2020 US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained). Costs and QALYs were discounted 3.0% per year. Model, Perspective, &amp; Time Frame: Cost-effectiveness analysis, commercial insurers and Medicare perspective, lifetime horizon. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of empagliflozin with SOC versus SOC alone was $25,974 per QALY. Empagliflozin added 0.67 QALYs and $17,322 per patient over a lifetime horizon. Results were driven by fewer clinical events (including CV death, heart failure hospitalization, albuminuria progression, and a composite kidney outcome) experienced by patients receiving empagliflozin with SOC versus SOC alone. Results were sensitive to rates of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and heart failure hospitalization, as well as to drug costs and time horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated 91% of simulations at &lt;$50,000 per QALY. Limitations: The EMPA-REG OUTCOME study was not powered to assess treatment benefits in a subgroup and excluded patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2.

This understanding is not mature yet, and there are wide areas of possible improvement. In particular, the fast mobilization and reconfiguration of resources frequently result into the severe disruption of elective activities, worsening the quality of care. More resilient resource allocation strategies, ie, which adapt to the dynamics of the prevailing circumstance, are needed to maximize the effectiveness of health-care delivery. In this study, a simulation approach was adopted to assess and compare different hospital's adaptive resource allocation strategies in responding to a mass casualty incident (MCI). Methods: A specific set of performance metrics was developed to take into consideration multiple objectives and priorities and holistically assess the effectiveness of health-care delivery when coping with an MCI event. Discrete event simulation (DES) and system dynamics (SD) were used to model the key hospital processes and the MCI plan. Results: In the daytime scenario, during the recovery phase of the emergency, a gradual disengagement of resources from the emergency department (ED) to restart ordinary activities in operating rooms and wards, returned the best performance. In the night scenario, the absorption capacity of the ED was evaluated by identifying the current bottleneck and assessment of the benefit of different resource mobilization strategies. Conclusions: The present study offers a robust approach, effective strategies, and new insights to design more resilient plans to cope with MCIs. Future research is needed to widen the scope of the analysis and take into consideration additional resilience capacities, such as operational coordination mechanisms, among multiple hospitals in the same geographic area. ©",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 11:54:26,,1105-1115,,3,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,simulation; case study; mass casualty (MCI); resilience; resource allocation strategies; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,AnyLogic,0,,,,,,,,

Methods: A discrete event simulation (DES) model was implemented to compare the lifetime cost-effectiveness of AADs, STAI, and CB2. AF disease progression was explicitly modeled based on the Atrial Fibrillation Progression Trial clinical study results. The base-case analysis assumed that patients with paroxysmal AF (PAF) entered the model at the age of 55 years and had a CHA2DS2-VASc (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ( > 65 = 1 point, > 75 = 2 points), Diabetes, previous Stroke/transient ischemic attack (2 points)-Vascular disease (peripheral arterial disease, previous myocardial infarction, aortic atheroma), Age 65 to 74 years, and Sex category) score of 2 for males and 3 for females. Model parameter uncertainties were incorporated throughout the DES simulation with full probabilistic model parameterization. Results: The lifetime cost-effectiveness evaluations showed that patients treated with AADs gained an average of 4.98 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and 9.63 life-years (LYs) at an average cost of US dollar (USD) 15 374. Patients treated with CB2 gained 5.92 QALYs and 10.74 LYs at an average cost of USD 26 811. The STAI group gained an average of 6.55 QALYs and 11.57 LYs at an average cost of USD 24 722. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios was USD 5927 and USD 12 167 per QALY for STAI versus AADs and CB2 versus AADs, respectively. Assuming the willingness-to-pay threshold for China is USD 30 390 per QALY, both ablation treatments will be cost-effective compared with AADs for patients with PAF. Conclusions: The DES model demonstrated that catheter ablations are more cost-effective than AADs for patients with PAF under the healthcare system in China. Among catheter ablation technologies, STAI provides better outcomes at lower costs. © 2021 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:47:21,,975-983,,6,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; cost-effectiveness; ablation; atrial fibrillation; Yes,0,1,1,0,ISPOR,0,Python ,1,,,,,,,,

It is thus critical for such facilities to optimize the diagnostic process to enable maximum testing on minimum resources. The current standard of diagnosis is the detection of the viral nucleic acid in clinical specimens. Methods: In order to optimize the laboratory’s nucleic acid testing system for COVID-19, we performed a Discrete-Event-Simulation using the Arena Simulation Software to model the detection process based on the data obtained from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (FAHGMU). The maximum of total time that specimens spent and the equipment consumption was compared under different scenarios in the model. Results: Seven scenarios were performed to simulate actual situation and improved situations. We analyzed conditions that adding a new nucleic acid extraction system (NAES), shifting a member from night duty to morning duty, using specimen tubes containing guanidine isothiocyanate (GITC), then tested the maximum testing capacity in the current number of technicians. In addition, the costs including personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing kits was calculated. Conclusions: A work schedule based on specimen-load improves efficiency without incurring additional costs, while using the specimen tubes containing GITC could reduce testing time by 30 min.

Home telemonitoring (HTM) facilitates frequent or continuous assessment of disease signs and symptoms, and it has shown to improve compliance by involving patients in their own care and prevent emergency admissions by facilitating early detection of clinically significant changes. Diagnostic algorithms (DAs) are predictive mathematical relationships that make use of a wide range of collected data for calculating the likelihood of a particular event and use this output for prioritizing patients with regard to their treatment. Objective: This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of HTM and a DA in the management of heart failure in the Netherlands. Three interventions were analyzed: usual care, HTM, and HTM plus a DA. Methods: A previously published discrete event simulation model was used. The base-case analysis was performed according to the Dutch guidelines for economic evaluation. Sensitivity, scenario, and value of information analyses were performed. Particular attention was given to the cost-effectiveness of the DA at various levels of diagnostic accuracy of event prediction and to different patient subgroups. Results: HTM plus the DA extendedly dominates HTM alone, and it has a deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compared with usual care of €27,712 (currency conversion rate in purchasing power parity at the time of study: €1=US $1.29; further conversions are not applicable in cost-effectiveness terms) per quality-adjusted life year. The model showed robustness in the sensitivity and scenario analyses. HTM plus the DA had a 96.0% probability of being cost-effective at the appropriate €80,000 per quality-adjusted life year threshold. An optimal point for the threshold value for the alarm of the DA in terms of its cost-effectiveness was estimated. New York Heart Association class IV patients were the subgroup with the worst cost-effectiveness results versus usual care, while HTM plus the DA was found to be the most cost-effective for patients aged <65 years and for patients in New York Heart Association class I. Conclusions: Although the increased costs of adopting HTM plus the DA in the management of heart failure may seemingly be an additional strain on scarce health care resources, the results of this study demonstrate that, by increasing patient life expectancy by 1.28 years and reducing their hospitalization rate by 23% when compared with usual care, the use of this technology may be seen as an investment, as HTM plus the DA in its current form extendedly dominates HTM alone and is cost-effective compared with usual care at normally accepted thresholds in the Netherlands. ©Fernando Albuquerque de Almeida, Isaac Corro Ramos, Maiwenn Al, Maureen Rutten-van Mölken.",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:45:38,,,,2,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; cost-effectiveness; diagnostic algorithm; early warning systems; heart failure; home telemonitoring; Yes,0,1,1,1,ISPOR,0,R,1,,Github,,,,,no license,This paper doesn't actually report software or guidelines - had to look in previous reported use of the model to find that its in R/github/ispor.

Hence, we conducted this study to assess the cost-effectiveness of PK-guided prophylaxis with recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) versus standard prophylaxis in Chinese adult patients with severe hemophilia A. Methods: A discrete event simulation model was developed to simulate 10,000 patients with hemophilia A who received rFVIII treatment over a 1-year time horizon. The standard prophylaxis rFVIII dose was 30 IU/kg by intravenous injection. The PK-guided prophylaxis dosage was adjusted for each patient to maintain FVIII trough level at 1–5 IU/dL. Dosing interval for both approaches was kept fixed at 48 h. The health outcomes included annual joint bleed rate (AJBR) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The model considered the costs of drug. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated and scenario analysis was performed. Results: A total of 94.3% of patients receiving PK-guided individualized prophylaxis achieved the goal of maintaining the trough concentration at 1–5 IU/dL compared with 62.7% on standard prophylaxis. AJBR and QALYs gained in PK-guided and standard prophylaxis were 1.527 vs 1.601, and 0.8384 vs 0.8383, respectively. Costs of drug prophylaxis and costs of treatment for bleeding events in PK-guided prophylaxis (148,641.47 USD; 4546.43 USD) were lower than those in standard prophylaxis (159,620.93 USD; 4753.39 USD). An average saving of USD 11,186.47 was obtained by the PK-guided approach. The prophylaxis treatment scenarios were the most influential factors. Conclusion: PK-guided individualized prophylaxis appeared to be a dominant treatment compared with standard prophylaxis, with slightly higher QALYs but lower total costs. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:30:37,,3777-3788,,8,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Hemophilia A; myPKFiT; Pharmacoeconomics; Pharmacokinetics-guided; Prophylaxis; Yes,0,1,1,0,ISPOR,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

This study was focused on developing a decision-support tool to help infusion centres plan their operations. Methods: A discrete event simulation model (‘ENTIMOS’) was developed using Simul8 software in collaboration with clinical experts. Model inputs included treatment-specific clinical parameters, resources such as infusion chairs and nursing staff, and costs, while model outputs included patient throughput, waiting time, queue size, resource utilisation, and costs. The model was parameterised using characteristics of the Charing Cross Hospital Infusion Centre in London, UK, where 12 infusion chairs were deployed for 170 non-MS and 860 MS patients as of March 2021. The number of MS patients was projected to increase by seven new patients per week. Results: The model-estimated waiting time for an infusion is, on average, 8 days beyond clinical recommendation in the first year of simulation. Without corrective action, the delay in receiving due treatment is anticipated to reach 30 days on average at 30 months from the start of simulation. Such system compromise can be prevented either by adding one infusion chair annually or switching 7% of existing patients or 24% of new patients to alternative MS treatments not requiring infusion. Conclusion: ENTIMOS is a flexible model of patient flow and care delivery in infusion centres serving MS patients. It allows users to simulate specific local settings and therefore identify measures that are necessary to avoid clinically significant treatment delay resulting in suboptimal care. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:44:15,,731-742,,5,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Simul8,0,,,,,,,,Availability of data and material:Not applicable since the model did not use patient-level data.

It is often saturated by a continuous flow of patients, which causes excessive patient waiting time. Aims: This study integrates simulations with optimisation to design planning decision support for an ED. We considered all the processes of the ED, from triage to bed assignment. This study's main objective was to determine the optimal number of doctors, nurses, and beds required to schedule patients with different acuity levels to minimise both the total patient waiting time and the patient average length of stay and balance the resource utilisation rates. The problem is also characterised by multiple uncertainties, such as the patient arrival rate and service times in each stage of the process. Method: We first propose a stochastic mixed-integer programing model that is solved using the sample average approximation approach. The resulting resource sizing is then evaluated using a discrete-event simulation model by comparing different patient scheduling rules. Results: Numerical experiments highlight the performance of the proposed approach using data from a Tunisian ED hospital. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 13:00:20,,2727-2751,,5,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,waiting time; discrete-event simulation; length of stay; emergency department crowding; resources' utilisation rates; stochastic optimisation; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,FlexSim,0,,,,,,,,The data that support the findings of this study are not publicly available due to privacy or ethical restrictions.

When the demand for these systems exceeds the available capacity, overcrowding occurs, leading to many negative consequences such as patient dissatisfaction, increased stress levels for caregivers, and financial loss for hospitals. Therefore, healthcare managers require decision support tools to rationalize their investment decisions and explore improvement opportunities throughout the emergency process. In this paper, a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model is developed to capture the randomness and complexity of the entire emergency healthcare chain, including an Emergency Medical Service (EMS), an Emergency Department (ED), and an Observation Unit (OU). This tool was then embedded in a Simulation-Optimization (SO) approach that simultaneously optimizes resource planning decisions and ambulance relocation in the emergency process while exploring the potential benefits of coordination between different stakeholders in terms of joint decision making. Solutions of the SO approach were assessed by the DES model regarding a wide range of KPIs to support a multiobjective approach necessary to spotlight the decision maker choice. The results show that the coordination between the different sub-systems could remarkably improve the global performance of the system. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 11:44:02,,,,,119,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; OR in health services; Emergency department; Care coordination; Emergency medical service; Healthcare Management; Simulation- optimization; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

Although progress has been made in recent years, substantial operational challenges persist in resource-limited settings with frequent stock-outs contributing to sub-optimal immunization coverage and inequality in vaccine access. In this paper, we investigate the role of rainy season induced supply chain disruptions on vaccination coverage and inequalities. We develop a modeling framework combining spatial modeling—to predict flood disruptions in road networks—and a discrete-event simulation of a multi-tiered vaccine supply chain (VSC). Our models are fitted using data from the Malagasy VSC network and validated to the best extent possible with scarce data. Our baseline simulation predicts the national vaccination coverage with good accuracy and suggests that 67% of regions with low reported immunization coverage are affected by rainy season disruptions or operational inefficiencies, causing significant geographical inequalities in vaccine access. We investigate various mitigation strategies to increase the resiliency of VSCs and find that, by strategically placing buffer inventory at targeted facilities prior to the rainy season, the proportion of children receiving all basic vaccines in these areas is increased by 8% and the geographical inequality in vaccination coverage between areas affected and not affected by the rainy season is reduced by 11%. By also increasing the replenishment frequency from every third month to every month, the national vaccination coverage improves by 41%. Our results contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by providing actionable insights for improving vaccination coverage (SDG 3) and investigating the resiliency of the VSC to increased flooding due to climate change (SDG 13). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 15:00:28,,300-317,,1,301,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete-event simulation; Global health; OR in developing countries; Spatial modeling; Vaccine supply chain design; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,AnyLogic,0,,,,,,,,More info about model in supp material

In the United Kingdom, one of the strategies used by hospitals to cope with the surge in patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 was to cancel a vast number of elective treatments planned and limit its resources for non-critical patients. This resulted in a 30% drop in the number of people joining the waiting list in 2020–2021 versus 2019–2020. Once the pandemic subsides and resources are freed for elective treatment, the expectation is that the patients failing to receive treatment throughout the pandemic would trigger a significant backlog on the waiting list post-pandemic with major repercussions to patient health and quality of life. As the nation emerges from the worst phase of the pandemic, hospitals are focusing on strategies to prioritise patients for elective treatments. A key challenge in this context is the ability to quantify the expected backlog and predict the delays experienced by patients as an outcome of the prioritisation policies. This study presents an approach based on discrete-event simulation to predict the elective waiting list backlog along with the delay in treatment based on a predetermined prioritisation policy. The model is demonstrated using data on the endoscopy waiting list at Cambridge University Hospitals. The model shows that 21% of the patients on the waiting list will experience a delay less than 18-weeks, the acceptable threshold set by the National Health Service (NHS). A longer-term scenario analysis based on the model reveals investment in NHS resources will have a significant positive outcome for addressing the waiting lists. The model presented in this paper has the potential to be an invaluable tool for post-pandemic planning for hospitals around the world that are facing a crisis of treatment backlog. © 2022 The Author(s)",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 11:41:30,,,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Simulation modelling; Pandemic recovery; Predictive model; Waiting list management; Yes,0,1,1,0,STRESS,1,Arena,0,,,,,,Model on request,,

Anecdotally, radiology staff reported increasing levels of workload associated with the patient profile. In this paper, we propose a framework combining discrete event simulation (DES) modeling and soft systems methodologies (SSM) for use in healthcare which captures the staff experience and metrics to evidence workload. The framework was applied in a single-scanner CT department, which completes circa 6000 examinations per year. The scanner case load consists of unscheduled work [inpatient (IP) and emergency department (ED)] and scheduled work [outpatient (OP) and general practitioner (GP)]. The three stage framework is supported by qualitative and quantitative methods and uses DES as a decision support tool. Firstly, workflow mapping and system dynamics are used to conceptualize the problem situation and instigate a preliminary data analysis. Secondly, SSM tools are used to identify components for a DES model and service improvement scenarios. Lastly, the DES model results are used to inform decision-making and identify a satisficing solution. Data from the DES model provided evidence of the differing workload (captured in staff time) for the IP and OP cohorts. For non-contrast examinations, inpatient workload is 2.5 times greater than outpatient. Average IP process delays of 11.9 min were demonstrated compared to less than 1 min for OP. The findings recommend that OP and IP diagnostic imaging be provided separately, for efficiency, workload management and infection control reasons. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:47:12,,,,5,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; Decision support; Radiology; Soft systems methodology; Workload; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,AnyLogic,0,,,,,,Model code on request,,

Patient screening is necessary because LEAD patients have an increased risk of occurrence of other cardiovascular events and manifestations of disease, in terms of leg symptoms such as intermittent claudication, critical limb ischemia, or amputation. The aim of this work was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening using ABI diagnostics in asymptomatic patients and its impact on limb symptoms associated with LEAD. A discrete event simulation model was created to capture lifetime costs and effects. Costs were calculated from the perspective of the health care payer, and the effects were calculated as QALYs. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to compare ABI screening examination and the situation without such screening. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis were carried out to evaluate the robustness of the results. In the basic setting, the screening intervention was a more expensive intervention, at a cost of CZK 174,010, compared to CZK 70,177 for the strategy without screening. The benefits of screening were estimated at 14.73 QALYs, with 14.46 QALYs without screening. The final ICER value of CZK 389,738 per QALY is below the willingness to pay threshold. Likewise, the results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis and of the scenario analysis were below the threshold of willingness to pay, thus confirming the robustness of the results. In conclusion, ABI screening appears to be a cost-effective strategy for asymptomatic patients aged 50 years when compared to the no-screening option. © 2022 by the authors.",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 12:42:48,,,,18,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; cost-effectiveness analysis; ankle-brachial index; lower extremity arterial disease; screening; Yes,0,1,1,0,ISPOR,0,R,1,,,,,,,,

This research addresses a gap in the literature by presenting a new data-driven modelling framework ‘GE-DES’, which outlines an approach to the design and development of generalisable ED models. The nature of the framework means that it is sufficiently flexible (i) for use across multiple EDs, and (ii) for investigating hospital-specific problems through data-driven customisation. The primary aim of GE-DES is to support model reuse and implementation.

DESIGN: The DST is powered by discrete event simulation which captures the entire patient pathway. To estimate the number of COPD admissions under different scenario settings, a regression model was developed and embedded into the tool. The tool can generate a wide range of patient-related and service-related outputs. Thus, the likely impact of possible changes (eg, COVID-19 restrictions and pandemic scenarios) on patients with COPD and care can be estimated. SETTING: COPD services (including outpatient and inpatient departments) at a major provider in central London. RESULTS: Four different scenarios (reflecting the UK government's Plan A, Plan B and Plan C in addition to a benchmark scenario) were run for 1 year. 856, 616 and 484 face-to-face appointments (among 1226 clinic visits) are expected in Plans A, B and C, respectively. Clinic visit quality in Plan A is found to be marginally better than in Plans B and C. Under coronavirus restrictions, lung function tests decreased more than 80% in Plan C as compared with Plan A. Fewer COPD exacerbation-related admissions were seen (284.1 Plan C vs 395.1 in the benchmark) associated with stricter restrictions. Although the results indicate that fewer quality-adjusted life years (in terms of COPD management) would be lost during more severe restrictions, the wider impact on physical and mental health must also be established. CONCLUSIONS: This DST will enable COPD services to examine how the latest developments in care delivery and management might impact their service during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the event of future pandemics. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Several methodologies have been developed to support these improvement processes, many of which apply Process Mining (PM) to investigate the current states of processes. Some even use Discrete Event Simulation (DES) techniques to explore alternative scenarios. Among the ones using DES, some rely on Multicriteria Decision-Making Methods (MCDM) to guide them in choosing the best scenario, especially in complex decision-making environments. However, no author presents a single framework combining all three techniques mentioned above, to wit, PM, DES, and MCDM. This paper targets developing this combination and exploring its usefulness in guiding process improvement in the health services area. The clinical path for stroke patients, covering from onset of symptoms to hospital discharge, was used as a test case. The research demonstrated that this proposal provided an innovative diagnostic of the process, identifying the activities that should be improved to obtain the most significant results in the process management indicators. Identifying the activities ensures that the impacts of these improvements are indicated with statistical accuracy and eliminating the need to perform on-site testing to test for the best solutions. The research does not address root cause diagnosis of activities to be improved. Therefore, further research needs to be undertaken on an extension of the model to enhance root cause analysis capabilities with a view to validating the framework proposed in other environments and, in this way, assess its replicability. © 2022",2022,2022-10-26 15:47:45,2022-11-01 11:37:36,,,,,120,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Stroke; Discrete Event Simulation; Healthcare; Decision making support; Process mining; PROMETHEE II method; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,1,Simul8,0,,,,,,,,Doesn't mention software - previous use of model describes Simul8

Treatment costs may also increase since pregnant women with diverse pathologies can develop more severe complications. As a step towards improving this process, we propose a methodological approach to reduce the appointment lead-time in outpatient gynecobstetrics departments. This framework involves combining the Six Sigma method to identify defects in the appointment scheduling process with a discrete-event simulation (DES) to evaluate the potential success of removing such defects in simulation before we resort to changing the real-world healthcare system. To do these, we initially characterize the gynecobstetrics department using a SIPOC diagram. Then, six sigma performance metrics are calculated to evaluate how well the department meets the government target in relation to the appointment lead-time. Afterwards, a cause-and-effect analysis is undertaken to identify potential causes of appointment lead-time variation. These causes are later validated through ANOVA, regression analysis, and DES. Improvement scenarios are next designed and pretested through computer simulation models. Finally, control plans are deployed to maintain the results achieved through the implementation of the DES-Six sigma approach. The aforementioned framework was validated in a public gynecobstetrics outpatient department. The results revealed that mean waiting time decreased from 6.9 days to 4.1 days while variance passed from 2.46 days2 to 1.53 days2. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 14:09:10,,,378,,12199 LNCS,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,Pages: 389 DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-49907-5_27,,,,Healthcare; Six sigma; Appointment lead time; Discrete-event simulation (DES); Gynecology; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, the hospital decision-makers have suggested planning the expansion, and it was carried out by the simulation and modeling method. The emergency department was simulated by the software FlexSim Healthcare R, and, with the Design of Experiments (DoE), the optimal number of beds, seats, and resources for each shift was determined. Data collection and modeling were executed based on historical data (patients' arrival) and from some databases that are in use by the hospital, from April 1st, 2017 to March 31st, 2018. The experiments were carried out by running 30 replicates for each scenario. Results. The results show that the emergency department cannot meet expected demand in the initial planning scenario. Only 17.2% of the patients were completed treated, and LOS was 2213.7 (average), with a confidence interval of (2131.82295.6) min. However, after changing decision variables and applying LT techniques, the treated patients' number increased to 95.7% (approximately 600%). Average LOS decreased to 461.2, with a confidence interval of (453.7468.7) min, about 79.0%. The time to be attended after the triage decrease from 404.3 min to 20.8 (19.821.8) min, around 95.0%, while the time to be transferred from bed to the SSU decreased by 60.0%. Moreover, the ED reduced human resources downtime, according to Lean Thinking principles. © 2020 Gabriel et al.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 14:20:21,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Forecasting; Demand; DES; Design of experiments; Expansion; Lean healthcare; Yes,0,1,1,1,None,0,FlexSim,0,,,,,,,,"The analysis of DoE, the FlexSim Healthcare software code and instructions to open the code are available in Supplemental Files - need FlexSim to open"

Mainly, the enhancement and progress of healthcare are fundamental in wellbeing improvement. This paper points to the utilization of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0 concepts oriented to the optimization of a Smart Hospital using the Hospital Emergency Department (HED) as a case study. This proposal focuses on the development of a smart Hospital-based of the IoT, Industry 4.0, Health 4.0, and other current technology. On the other hand, the use of a computational simulation tool like the Discrete Event Simulation Model (DES) will allow the test, recognition, and reduction of bottlenecks in the HED workflow. The issue given by the bottlenecks is automatically controlled using an improved dynamic shift management proposal based on control theory, forecasting methods, and telemedicine. The results show an improvement in the use of the resources and a reduction of the length of stay that directly reduces the HED mortality rate, improving the service quality. The objective of this paper is to propose a simulation tool-based on DES for a selected HED, using forecasting methods of the patients' arrival in a HED using the Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. Following the forecasted entries, a proposal for bottleneck avoidance using a HED DES was realized. The forecasting data provided useful predictive information for the improvement of the HED workflow. As well as the analyzed data of a traditional HED system is helpful to solve the overcrowding problem. Finally, the use of simulation tools allows the test and validation of novel proposals for two smart HED optimization proposals following e-Health and Hospital 4.0 principles. © 2020 Brazilian Institute for Information in Science and Technology.

Improving these indicators is a very important issue for hospital management, so finding a solution to achieve it in a simple and effective way is one of the greatest goals. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this article is to evaluate the use of a discrete event simulation model to improve healthcare processes and reduce waiting time of patients and hospital costs. METHODS: The case study proposed in this paper is the reorganization of non-clinical front office operation for the patients (i.e. booking of exams, delivering medical reports, etc.) of the Careggi University Hospital of Florence, to optimize the utilization of the human resources and to improve performances of the process. RESULTS: The development and validation of the model was made according to an analysis of real processes and data, pre and post implementation of model outcomes. The new organization shows a decrease of waiting times from an average value of 10 minutes and 37 seconds to 5 minutes and 57 seconds (-44%).

This is further intensified by inefficient management of hospital resources. Hence, it is essential to efficiently manage hospital resource as it will lead to health care costs reduction and increased patient's satisfaction. The focus of this research is to demonstrate the use of the tool in healthcare system, specifically in Pakistan, and balance the resources of a hospital, which will reduce the waiting time for the Outdoor Patients Departments. The resources at the Outdoor Patients Department including X-ray, Labs, Ultrasound and the ECG sections were included in the computer-based simulation model with the aim to find the bottleneck departments as they are the main cause of waiting time in the hospital. These bottlenecks are anticipated due to the lack of an optimized model, which has been addressed in this simulation. Based on the simulation study an optimized model is proposed to the hospital administration where the resources are readjusted resulting in the utilization of underutilized departments and decreasing the waiting time of the stations particularly the bottleneck stations. The motivation behind this research is to aid hospitals in better management of resources, which can ultimately improve customers (patients) satisfaction. © 2013 IEEE.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 11:21:08,,193523-193531,,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,patient flow; waiting time; Discrete event simulation (DES); medical record number (MRN); outpatient department (OPD); split flow; utilization; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Simio,0,,,,,,,,

Indeed, it assesses operational conditions for minimizing the spread of disease due to a) uniforms' exposure to germs and pathogens, directly related to the distribution process of these uniforms b) insufficient inventory level due to personnel's unusual behaviors in the pandemic context, involving extended use of potentially infected uniforms due to a shortage of uniforms on distribution shelves.

Factors including space layout, patient behavior, and medical procedures interact and relate to each other, and ultimately affect hospital operational efficiency. The improvement in hospital operational efficiency involves the comprehensive consideration of multiple variables and objectives, which makes decision-making tasks extremely challenging. The objective of this study is to identify system bottlenecks and explore potential improvement strategies to reduce the patient waiting time and length of stay while maximizing the use of key healthcare resources. Simulation in healthcare is an effective approach to understand the interdependencies between human-oriented and infrastructure-oriented variables in complex systems and to explore decision scenarios from different stakeholders or practitioners. This study used the integration of discrete event simulation (DES) and agent-based simulation (ABS) to simulate medical procedures and patient behavior of a gastroenterology clinic at Shanghai. On this basis, different improvement measures were evaluated, such as human resource adjustment strategies and department resource modifications programs. The research results were validated and indicated that the integrated simulation method has successfully helped clinic administrators achieve better performance while using resources more efficiently.

As vaccines are expected to be developed and produced, preparedness and planning for mass vaccination and immunization will become an important aspect of the pandemic management. Mass vaccination has been used by public health agencies in the past and is being proposed as a viable option for COVID-19 immunization. To be able to rapidly and safely immunize a large number of people against SARS-CoV-2, different mass vaccination options are available. Drive-through facilities have been successfully used in the past for immunization against other diseases and for testing during COVID-19. In this paper we introduce a drive-through vaccination simulation tool that can be used to enhance the planning, design, operation, and feasibility and effectiveness assessment of such facilities.

The patient flow throughout the hospital is affected by lack of the capacities that can lead to bed-blocking among the hospital units. In this research, the patient flow in the hospital is modeled as an open queueing network with blocking. Then, the hospital capacity planning is implemented to reduce the blocking using a simulation-based optimization approach in such a way that the total cost will not exceed from the accessible budget. Methods: This research is an applied research in terms of purpose, which is a descriptive-survey research in terms of data collection method. The data were collected during the first six months of the year 1396 in the selected hospital of Lorestan province. The research process is a combination of the bi-objective mathematical modeling and discrete-event simulation. Results: By analyzing the simulation results of the current situation, 43 scenarios were proposed to improve patient flow in the hospital units. Then, nine Pareto-optimal scenarios were determined by using the mathematical model on the simulation results of the proposed scenarios. Conclusion: In order to facilitate the selection of the optimal scenario by hospital administrators, the Pareto-optimal scenarios were classified and analyzed in two categories. The integration of the simulation model with the proposed mathematical model can lead to developing a practical approach for capacity planning and improvement of patient flow which can be used by other hospitals. © 2020.

An efficient ED configuration that is cost and time effective must be developed by this company for hospital managers. In this paper, the problem of health-care professional configurations in EDs is modelled to minimise the total labour cost while satisfying patient queues and waiting times as defined by the actual ED capacity and current clinical protocols. To solve this issue, mixed integer linear programming (MILP) that allocates health-care professionals and specifies the amount of professionals who must be hired is proposed. To consider the uncertainties in this environment and evaluate their impacts, a discrete-event simulation model is developed to reflect patient flow. An optimisation and simulation approach is used to search for efficiency leads for different ED configurations. These configurations change depending on the shift and the day of the week. © 2019, © Operational Research Society 2019.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 14:08:31,,2-30,,1,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,emergency department; discrete event simulation; Health care operation management; mixed integer linear programming; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

Operating rooms are one of the most expensive resources in any healthcare system. The average amount of cost for any operating room for a less complex procedure is around $29/min, while the more complex procedures cost up to $80/min. Many studies have been conducted to analyze and understand the reasons behind surgery cancellation; however, a handful of studies aimed to predict which patients have a large risk of cancellation. We used four different traditional data mining techniques—Conditional Inference Tree, C5.0, logistic regression, and Radial Basis Function Kernel Support Vector Machine—to predict surgical cancellations to create efficient surgical patients’ schedules. Then, a stacking generalization ensemble machine was developed and compared to the traditional methods. Three different scheduling scenarios were developed and tested using discrete event simulation (DES). The stacking generalization ensemble machine outperformed all traditional data mining techniques and the benchmark algorithm with an accuracy of 95% and area under the curve (AUC) of 96%. The proposed simulation-based optimization scheduling technique increased the operating room use by 13%. Surgeries cancellation prediction leads to efficient scheduling that ultimately leads to reductions in expenditure.

To better manage workload, it is necessary to understand the drivers of workload. This report provides an adaptable modeling approach that can isolate and quantify the effects of changing technical design and operational policies in terms of nurse workload and quality of care. A demonstrator model is presented that tested two known drivers of workload: nurse-patient ratio and patient acuity. The results revealed that when nurse-patient ratios and patient acuity levels increased, nurse workload increased and quality of care deteriorated. This adaptable modeling approach can assist policymakers in quantifying the consequences of technical design and policy tradeoffs; architects in better designing inpatient unit-layouts; and hospital managers in creating safer work environments for nurses by quantifying their workload demands proactively. This modeling tool also offers a cost effective and safer alternative to trial-and-error methodologies. © 2020, Copyright © 2020 “IISE”.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 13:49:21,,27-41,,1,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; healthcare ergonomics; healthcare policy; human factors; nurse-patient ratio; patient acuity; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

Parameters of pathway performance include distances to primary and comprehensive stroke centres (CSCs), time to treatment and availability of ambulance services. Further expansion of IAT centres may increase treatment rates yet could affect efficient use of resources and quality of care due to lower treatment volume. The aim was to study the organisation of care and patient logistics of IAT for patients with ischaemic stroke in the Netherlands. Methods and analyses Using a simulation modelling approach, we will quantify performance of 16 primary and CSCs offering IAT in the Netherlands. Patient data concerning both prehospital and intrahospital pathway logistics will be collected and used as input for model validation. A previously validated simulation model for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) patients will be expanded with data of the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands) Registry and trials performed in the Collaboration for New Treatments in Acute Stroke consortium to represent patient logistics, time delays and outcomes in IAT patients. Simulation experiments aim to assess effectiveness and efficiency of alternative network topologies, that is, IAT with or without IVT at the nearest primary stroke centre (PSC) versus centralised care at a CSC. Primary outcomes are IAT treatment rates and clinical outcome according to the modified Rankin Scale. Secondary outcomes include onset-to-treatment time and resource use. Mann-Whitney U and Fisher's exact tests will be used to estimate differences for continuous and categorical variables. Model and parameter uncertainty will be tested using sensitivity analyses. Ethics and dissemination This will be the first study to examine the organisation of acute stroke care for IAT delivery on a national scale using discrete event simulation. There are no ethics or safety concerns regarding the dissemination of information, which includes publication in peer-reviewed journals and (inter)national conference presentations.

However, its sensitivity is relatively low, especially for small and peripheral lesions. We assessed benefits and costs of introducing a bronchial gene-expression classifier (BGC) to improve the performance of bronchoscopy and the overall diagnostic process for early detection of lung cancer. We used discrete-event simulation to compare clinical and economic outcomes of two different strategies with the standard practice in former and current smokers with indeterminate nodules: (i) location-based strategy—integrated the BGC to the bronchoscopy indication; (ii) simplified strategy—extended use of bronchoscopy plus BGC also on small and peripheral lesions. Outcomes modeled were rate of invasive procedures, quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs), costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Compared to the standard practice, the location-based strategy (i) reduced absolute rate of invasive procedures by 3.3% without increasing costs at the current BGC market price. It resulted in savings when the BGC price was less than $3,000. The simplified strategy (ii) reduced absolute rate of invasive procedures by 10% and improved quality-adjusted life expectancy, producing an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $10,109 per QALY. In patients with indeterminate nodules, both BGC strategies reduced unnecessary invasive procedures at high risk of adverse events. Moreover, compared to the standard practice, the simplified use of BGC for central and peripheral lesions resulted in larger QALYs gains at acceptable cost. The location-based is cost-saving if the price of classifier declines. © 2019 UICC",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 11:06:52,,781-790,,3,146,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,cost–benefit analysis; bronchoscopy; early detection of cancer; genomics; lung cancer; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

In such cases, it is indispensable to develop highly efficient data transmission methods. However, patients from less-favored countries face long waiting periods for scheduling and medical care. Much of this delay is due to the lack of innovation and technology in the bureaucratic sectors of the medical field. Based on this, the present study aims to implement a discrete event simulation (DES)-based model. This model is called coding of bits for entities by means of discrete events (CBEDE) and aims to assist the health systems of less-favored countries by categorizing a broad spectrum of health-related topics, as well as improving transmission of medical data through e-healthcare devices. Two models of systems were developed in the Matlab® Simulink environment, where data were analyzed through simulations with the CBEDE methodology with the advanced modulation differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK) format and traditional methodology (without discrete events) in relation to information consumption data in megabytes (MB). The model, without the proposal and with discrete events, consumed 247.7 MB; in contrast, the model with the proposal had 114.16 MB of consumption. There was also a better computational performance (reaching up to 116.97%) related to the use of information compression memory. Therefore, the CBEDE methodology presents great potential for the transmission of medical data, allowing faster and more efficient scheduling of consultations or by transmission devices monitoring data from patients with chronic and/or elderly diseases. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

We used prospectively collected sarcoma data to describe current surveillance imaging practice in patients with AJCC stage II and III extremity STS and evaluate its cost-effectiveness. Methods: From three selected Australian sarcoma referral centres, we identified patients with stage II and III extremity STS treated between 2009 and 2013. Medical records were reviewed to ascertain surveillance imaging practices, including modality, frequency and patient outcomes. A discrete event simulation model was developed and calibrated using clinical data to estimate health service costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with alternative surveillance strategies. Results: Of 133 patients treated for stage II and III extremity STS, the majority were followed up with CT chest (86%), most commonly at 3-monthly intervals and 62% of patients had the primary site imaged with MRI at 6-monthly. There was limited use of chest-X-ray. A discrete event simulation model demonstrated that CT chest screening was the most cost effective surveillance strategy, gaining additional QALYs at a mean incremental cost of $30,743. MRI alone and PET-CT alone were not cost-effective, whilst a combined strategy of CT + MRI had an incremental cost per QALY gained of $96,556. Conclusions: Wide variations were observed in surveillance imaging practices in this high-risk STS cohort. Modelling demonstrated the value of CT chest for distant recurrence surveillance over other forms of imaging in terms of cost and QALYs. Further work is required to evaluate cost-effectiveness in a prospective manner. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 13:45:49,,,,1,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Cost-effectiveness; Disease recurrence; Distant recurrence; Imaging surveillance; Local recurrence; Metastasectomy; Pulmonary metastases; Soft tissue sarcoma; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,,The datasets used for the analysis in the study can be made available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request,,

Methods: The impact of TOE on surgical decision-making was estimated through a systematic literature review. Individual short-term morbidity and mortality estimates were generated by application of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk calculator. Long-term event rates, unit costs, and utility weights were sourced from published literature and expert opinion. A discrete-event simulation model was then constructed to simulate both the in-hospital and post-discharge outcomes for patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Robustness of the base case results was examined through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. An incremental cost–effectiveness ratio of €30 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained was assumed to represent acceptable cost-effectiveness. Results: Routine use of intraoperative TOE was associated with lower costs and higher benefits per patient, which indicates that use of TOE is a dominant strategy. The intervention resulted in the avoidance of 299 cardiac complications, 20 strokes, and 11 all-cause deaths per 10 000 patients. Routine intraoperative TOE was associated with an increased occurrence of bleeding owing to more valvular surgery and subsequent long-term anticoagulation. Conclusions: Routine intraoperative TOE is a cost-effective procedure for patients undergoing cardiac surgery, leading to lower overall costs. It was associated with a decrease in long-term complications including stroke, cardiac complications, and death, although there was a slight increase in extracranial bleeding events. © 2019 British Journal of Anaesthesia",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 13:46:15,,136-145,,2,124,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,cardiac anaesthesia; cost–benefit analysis; echocardiography; long-term outcomes; simulation study; transoesophageal; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Treeage,0,,,,,,,,

This has large impacts on health and social care, unpaid carers and lost productivity. We aimed to estimate associated costs. Methods: we estimated 2014/2015 annual mean cost per person and aggregate UK cost of stroke for individuals aged ≥40 from a societal perspective. Health and social care costs in the first and subsequent years after stroke were estimated from discrete event simulation modelling, with probability of progression and length of receipt of different health and social care services obtained from routine registry and audit data. Unpaid care hours and lost productivity were obtained from trial data. UK unit costs were applied to estimate mean costs. Epidemiological estimates of stroke incidence and prevalence were then applied to estimate aggregate costs for the UK. Results: mean cost of new-onset stroke is £45,409 (95% CI 42,054-48,763) in the first year after stroke and £24,778 (20,234-29,322) in subsequent years. Aggregate societal cost of stroke is £26 billion per year, including £8.6 billion for NHS and social care. The largest component of total cost was unpaid care (61%) and, given high survival, £20.6 billion related to ongoing care. Conclusion: the estimated aggregate cost of stroke substantially exceeds previous UK estimates. Since most of the cost is attributed to unpaid care, interventions aimed at rehabilitation and reducing new and recurrent stroke are likely to yield substantial benefits to carers and cost savings to society. © The Author(s) 2019.

When the preferred assignment is not possible, typically due to capacity limits, hospitals often allow for overflow, which is the assignment of patients to other services and/or units. Overflow accelerates assignment, but can also reduce care quality and increase length of stay. This paper develops a discrete-event simulation model to evaluate different assignment strategies. Using a simulation-based optimization approach, we evaluate and heuristically optimize these strategies accounting for expected hospital and physician profit, care quality and patient waiting time. We apply the model using data from the University of Chicago Medical Center. We find that the strategies that use heuristically optimized designation of overflow services and units increase expected profit relative to the capacity-based strategy in which overflow patients are assigned to a service and unit with the most available capacity. We also find further improvement in the strategy that uses heuristically optimized overflow services and units as well as a holding unit that holds patients until a bed in their primary or secondary unit becomes available. Additionally, we demonstrate the effects of these strategies on other performance measures such as patient concentration, waiting time, and outcomes. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 14:51:25,,117-141,,1,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Simulation; Decision support systems; Hospital services; Optimization; Patient assignment; Patient overflow; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

Planning the clinic is further complicated due to the high did not attend rates as a result of women giving birth. The aim of this study is to determine the maximum number of women specified clinic configurations, combination of specified clinic resources, can feasibly serve within clinic opening times. Methods: A hybrid agent based discrete event simulation model of the clinic was used to evaluate alternative configurations to gain insight into clinic planning and to support decision making. Clinic configurations consisted of six factors: X0: Arrivals. X1: Arrival pattern. X2: Order of midwife and doctor consultations. X3: Number of midwives. X4: Number of doctors. X5: Number of cardiotocography (CTGs) machines. A full factorial experimental design of the six factors generated 608 configurations. Results: Each configuration was evaluated using the following measures: Y1: Arrivals. Y2: Time last woman checks out. Y3: Women's length of stay (LoS). Y4: Clinic overrun time. Y5: Midwife waiting time (WT). Y6: Doctor WT. Y7: CTG connection WT. Optimisation was used to maximise X0 with respect to the 32 combinations of X1-X5. Configuration 0a, the base case Y1 = 7 women and Y3 = 102.97 [0.21] mins. Changing the arrival pattern (X1) and the order of the midwife and doctor consultations (X2) configuration 0d, where X3, X4, X5 = 0a, Y1 = 8 woman and Y3 86.06 [0.10] mins. Conclusions: The simulation model identified the availability of CTG machines as a bottleneck in the clinic, indicated by the WT for CTG connection effect on LoS. One additional CTG machine improved clinic performance to the same degree as an extra midwife and an extra doctor. The simulation model demonstrated significant reductions to LoS can be achieved without additional resources, by changing the clinic pathway and scheduling of appointments. A more general finding is that a simulation model can be used to identify bottlenecks, and efficient ways of restructuring an outpatient clinic. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 13:40:17,,,,1,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Simulation; Patient flow; Capacity planning; Optimisation; Outpatient; Post-term pregnancies; Hybrid; Yes,0,1,1,1,STRESS,0,Anylogic,0,Mendeley,,,,,,,

A genetic diagnosis can help these people and their families better understand their condition and may help them to connect with others who have the same condition. Ontario Health (Quality), in collaboration with the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) conducted a health technology assessment about the use of genome-wide sequencing for patients with unexplained developmental disabilities or multiple congenital anomalies. Ontario Health (Quality) evaluated the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of publicly funding genome-wide sequencing. We also conducted interviews with patients and examined the quantitative evidence of preferences and values literature to better understand the patient preferences and values for these tests. Methods Ontario Health (Quality) performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Non-randomized Studies (RoBANS) and the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We also performed a search of the quantitative evidence and undertook direct patient engagement to ascertain patient preferences for genetic testing for unexplained developmental disabilities or multiple congenital anomalies. CADTH performed a review of qualitative literature about patient perspectives and experiences, and a review of ethical issues. Ontario Health (Quality) performed an economic literature review of genome-wide sequencing in people with unexplained developmental disabilities or multiple congenital anomalies. Although we found eight published cost-effectiveness studies, none completely addressed our research question. Therefore, we conducted a primary economic evaluation using a discrete event simulation model. Owing to its high cost and early stage of clinical implementation, whole exome sequencing is primarily used for people who do not have a diagnosis from standard testing (referred to here as whole exome sequencing after standard testing; standard testing includes chromosomal microarray and targeted single-gene tests or gene panels). Therefore, in our first analysis, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of whole exome sequencing after standard testing versus standard testing alone. In our second analysis, we explored the cost-effectiveness of whole exome and whole genome sequencing used at various times in the diagnostic pathway (e.g., first tier, second tier, after standard testing) versus standard testing. We also estimated the budget impact of publicly funding genome-wide sequencing in Ontario for the next 5 years. Results Forty-four studies were included in the clinical evidence review. The overall diagnostic yield of genome-wide sequencing for people with unexplained development disability and multiple congenital anomalies was 37%, but we are very uncertain about this estimate (GRADE: Very Low). Compared with standard genetic testing of chromosomal microarray and targeted single-gene tests or gene panels, genome-wide sequencing could have a higher diagnostic yield (GRADE: Low). As well, for some who are tested, genome-wide sequencing prompts some changes to medications, treatments, and referrals to specialists (GRADE: Very Low). Whole exome sequencing after standard testing cost an additional $3,261 per patient but was more effective than standard testing alone. For every 1,000 persons tested, using whole exome sequencing after standard testing would lead to an additional 240 persons with a molecular diagnosis, 272 persons with any positive finding, and 46 persons with active treatment change (modifications to medications, procedures, or treatment). The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were $13,591 per additional molecular diagnosis. The use of genome-wide sequencing early in the diagnostic pathway (e.g., as a first- or second-tier test) can save on costs and improve diagnostic yields over those of standard testing. Results remained robust when parameters and assumptions were varied. Our budget impact analysis showed that, if whole exome sequencing after standard testing continues to be funded through Ontario’s Out-of-Country Prior Approval Program, its budget impact would range from $4 to $5 million in years 1 to 5. If whole exome sequencing becomes publicly funded in Ontario (not through the Out-of-Country Prior Approval Program), the budget impact would be about $9 million yearly. We also found that using whole exome sequencing as a second-tier test would lead to cost savings ($3.4 million per 1,000 persons tested yearly). Participants demonstrated consistent motivations for and expectations of obtaining a diagnosis for unexplained developmental delay or congenital anomalies through genome-wide sequencing. Patients and families greatly value the support and information they receive through genetic counselling when considering genome-wide sequencing and learning of a diagnosis. Conclusions Genome-wide sequencing could have a higher diagnostic yield than standard testing for people with unexplained developmental disabilities or multiple congenital anomalies. Genome-wide sequencing can also prompt some changes to medications, treatments, and referrals to specialists for some people tested; however, we are very uncertain about this. Genome-wide sequencing could be a cost-effective strategy when used after standard testing to diagnose people with unexplained developmental disabilities or multiple congenital anomalies.

In populous country like India, hospitals are not able to provide sufficient facilities to the patients. As a result, patients have to wait for long times in queues. Many times there are not sufficient drugs available in stock. Purpose of research is to achieve operational excellence in hospital by applying simulation. Operational excellence of the hospitals means that • Patients have to wait for less time in queues. • There is no shortage of drugs. For this, simulation is used. Simulation is a technique where experiments are conducted using models. These models represent real-world systems. Simulation for queues of hospital:Arrival times of patients and Service time of the server is collected from hospital. Then histogram is plotted. From the histogram, data is identified with a particular distribution and then new arrival and service times are generated using random variate generator of that distribution. Using these values, simulation is conducted. Output of simulation is analyzed. If it is found that server is overloaded, then decision to add new server is taken. Simulation for inventory management of hospital:Data for demand and lead time is collected from the hospital. Then data is identified with a particular distribution using histogram. New demand and lead time values are generated using random variate generator of a particular distribution. Using these values simulation is conducted. After simulation, if shortage is more then reorder level can be changed or order size can be changed. Major results Operational excellence can be achieved through appropriate decision making as result of simulation. Output of simulation is analyzed and modifications in queuing and inventory are done. This will lead to operational excellence of hospitals. © IAEME Publication.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 13:53:38,,32-43,,4,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Hospitals; Simulation; Inventory; Operational efficiency; Queues; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,C,1,,,,,,,,

We argue that there are two weaknesses within the generic simulation modelling literature. Firstly, that generic models sacrifice the relative simplicity of a bespoke simulation model for flexibility. Secondly, that generic models are published in conceptual form only. If researchers cannot access computer implementation of models, then there is little incentive or benefit to recode one over coding a simpler bespoke simulation model. We introduce an incremental approach to generic modelling in discrete-event simulation. We develop an archetype setting-specific generic model of a hospital ward. The archetype model is first developed and applied in a rehabilitation ward setting. Then a second team applies the model in a specialised intensive care setting.

Strategies to manage and prevent this condition are contested. Dynamic simulation models (DSM) can test policy and program scenarios before implementation in the real world. This paper reports the development and use of an advanced DSM exploring the impact of maternal weight status interventions on incidence of HIP. METHODS: A consortium of experts collaboratively developed a hybrid DSM of HIP, comprising system dynamics, agent-based and discrete event model components. The structure and parameterization drew on a range of evidence and data sources. Scenarios comparing population-level and targeted prevention interventions were simulated from 2018 to identify the intervention combination that would deliver the greatest impact. RESULTS: Population interventions promoting weight loss in early adulthood were found to be effective, reducing the population incidence of HIP by 17.3% by 2030 (baseline ('business as usual' scenario)=16.1%, 95% CI 15.8 to 16.4; population intervention=13.3%, 95% CI 13.0 to 13.6), more than targeted prepregnancy (5.2% reduction; incidence=15.3%, 95% CI 15.0 to 15.6) and interpregnancy (4.2% reduction; incidence=15.5%, 95% CI 15.2 to 15.8) interventions. Combining targeted interventions for high-risk groups with population interventions promoting healthy weight was most effective in reducing HIP incidence (28.8% reduction by 2030; incidence=11.5, 95% CI 11.2 to 11.8). Scenarios exploring the effect of childhood weight status on entry to adulthood demonstrated significant impact in the selected outcome measure for glycemic regulation, insulin sensitivity in the short term and HIP in the long term. DISCUSSION: Population-level weight reduction interventions will be necessary to 'turn the tide' on HIP. Weight reduction interventions targeting high-risk individuals, while beneficial for those individuals, did not significantly impact forecasted HIP incidence rates. The importance of maintaining interventions promoting healthy weight in childhood was demonstrated. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY.

This diagnostic delay is driven by patients' inclination to switch between different types of providers and providers' inclination to delay ordering of accurate diagnostic tests relevant to TB. Our objective is to quantify the impact of changes in these behavioral characteristics of providers and patients on diagnostic delay experienced by pulmonary TB patients. Methods and findings We developed a discrete event simulation model of patients' diagnostic pathways that captures key behavioral characteristics of providers (time to order a test) and patients (time to switch to another provider). We used an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the parameters underlying these behavioral characteristics, with quantitative data encoded from detailed interviews of 76 and 64 pulmonary TB patients in the 2 Indian cities of Mumbai and Patna, respectively, which were conducted between April and August 2014. We employed the estimated model to simulate different counterfactual scenarios of diagnostic pathways under altered behavioral characteristics of providers and patients to predict their potential impact on the diagnostic delay. Private healthcare providers including chemists were the first point of contact for the majority of TB patients in Mumbai (70%) and Patna (94%). In Mumbai, 45% of TB patients first approached less-than-fully-qualified providers (LTFQs), who take 28.71 days on average for diagnosis. About 61% of these patients switched to other providers without a diagnosis. Our model estimates that immediate testing for TB by LTFQs at the first visit (at the current level of diagnostic accuracy) could reduce the average diagnostic delay from 35.53 days (95% CI: 34.60, 36.46) to 18.72 days (95% CI: 18.01, 19.43). In Patna, 61% of TB patients first approached fully qualified providers (FQs), who take 9.74 days on average for diagnosis. Similarly, immediate testing by FQs at the first visit (at the current level of diagnostic accuracy) could reduce the average diagnostic delay from 23.39 days (95% CI: 22.77, 24.02) to 11.16 days (95% CI: 10.52, 11.81). Improving the diagnostic accuracy of providers per se, without reducing the time to testing, was not predicted to lead to any reduction in diagnostic delay. Our study was limited because of its restricted geographic scope, small sample size, and possible recall bias, which are typically associated with studies of patient pathways using patient interviews. Conclusions In this study, we found that encouraging private providers to order definitive TB diagnostic tests earlier during patient consultation may have substantial impact on reducing diagnostic delay in these urban Indian settings. These results should be combined with disease transmission models to predict the impact of changes in provider behavior on TB incidence. © 2020 Public Library of Science.

Objectives: To develop a whole-disease model for schizophrenia and use it to inform resource allocation decisions across the entire care pathway for schizophrenia in the UK. Design, Setting, and Participants: This decision analytical model used a whole-disease model to simulate the entire disease and treatment pathway among a simulated cohort of 200000 individuals at clinical high risk of psychoses or with a diagnosis of psychosis or schizophrenia being treated in primary, secondary, and tertiary care in the UK. Data were collected March 2016 to December 2018 and analyzed December 2018 to April 2019. Exposures: The whole-disease model used discrete event simulation; its structure and input data were informed by published literature and expert opinion. Analyses were conducted from the perspective of the National Health Service and Personal Social Services over a lifetime horizon. Key interventions assessed included cognitive behavioral therapy, antipsychotic medication, family intervention, inpatient care, and crisis resolution and home treatment team. Main Outcomes and Measures: Life-time costs and quality-adjusted life-years. Results: In the simulated cohort of 200000 individuals (mean [SD] age, 23.5 [5.1] years; 120800 [60.4%] men), 66400 (33.2%) were not at risk of psychosis, 69800 (34.9%) were at clinical high risk of psychosis, and 63800 (31.9%) had psychosis. The results of the whole-disease model suggest the following interventions are likely to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20000 ($25552) per quality-adjusted life-year: Practice as usual plus cognitive behavioral therapy for individuals at clinical high risk of psychosis (probability vs practice as usual alone, 0.96); a mix of hospital admission and crisis resolution and home treatment team for individuals with acute psychosis (probability vs hospital admission alone, 0.99); amisulpride (probability vs all other antipsychotics, 0.39), risperidone (probability vs all other antipsychotics, 0.30), or olanzapine (probability vs all other antipsychotics, 0.17) combined with family intervention for individuals with first-episode psychosis (probability vs family intervention or medication alone, 0.58); and clozapine for individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (probability vs other medications, 0.81). Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study suggest that the current schizophrenia service configuration is not optimal. Cost savings and/or additional quality-adjusted life-years may be gained by replacing current interventions with more cost-effective interventions.. © 2020 American Medical Association.

Their role is remarkable when extraordinary events that affect the public, such as earthquakes, occur. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework to evaluate earthquake preparedness of EDs in cities. Our hybrid framework uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) to estimate number of casualties and discrete event simulation (DES) to analyse the effect of surge in patient demand in EDs, after an earthquake happens. At the core of our framework, Earthquake Time Emergency Department Network Simulation Model (ET-EDNETSIM) resides which can simulate patient movements in a network of multiple and coordinated EDs. With the design of simulation experiments, different resource levels and sharing rules between EDs can be evaluated. We demonstrated our framework in a network of five EDs located in a region of which is estimated to have the highest injury rate after an earthquake in Istanbul, Turkey. Results of our study contributed to the planning for expected earthquake in Istanbul. Simulating a network of EDs extends the individual ED studies in the literature and furthermore, our hybrid framework can help increase earthquake preparedness in cities around the world.

These products are perishable and substitutable by nature and create complexities for managing inventory. Instead of a financial measure, numerous measures should be considered and balanced to meet business objectives and enhance inventory management. Design/methodology/approach: This research applies a multi-methodological approach and develops a framework that integrates discrete event simulation (DES), analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) techniques to define the most favourable replenishment policy using non-financial measures. Findings: The integration framework performs well as illustrated in the numerical example; outcomes from the framework are comparable to those generated using a traditional, financial measures-based, approach. This research demonstrates that it is feasible to adopt non-financial performance measures to define a replenishment policy and evaluate performance. Originality/value: The framework, thus, prioritises non-financial measures and addresses issues of lacking information sharing and employee involvement to enhance hospitals' performance while minimising costs. The non-financial measures improve cross-functional communication while supporting simpler transformations from high-level strategies to daily operational targets. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 14:09:26,,987-1002,,5,120,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Decision systems; Perishable inventory management; Substitutable; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,ExtendSim,0,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to apply DES to perform cost-effectiveness analysis of AD treatment in Thailand. Methods: A data set of Thai AD patients, representing unique demographic and clinical characteristics, was bootstrapped to generate a baseline cohort of 50 000 patients. Each patient was cloned and assigned to donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, memantine, or no treatment. Correlated changes in cognitive and behavioral status over time were developed using patient-level data. Treatment effects were obtained from the most recent network meta-analysis. Treatment persistence; mortality; and predictive equations for functional status, costs (Thai baht in 2017), and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) were derived from country-specific real-world data. Results: From a societal perspective, only the prescription of donepezil to AD patients with all disease-severity levels was found to be cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio): 138 524 Thai baht/QALY ($4062/QALY)]. Regardless of whether the treatment-stopping rule when the mini-mental state examination score <10 was introduced, providing early treatment with donepezil to mild AD patients further reduced the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Extensive sensitivity analyses indicated robust simulation findings. Conclusions: Discrete-event simulation greatly enhances the real-world representativeness of decision-analytic models for AD. Donepezil is the most cost-effective treatment option for AD in Thailand and is worth being considered for universal financial coverage.

Employing discrete event simulations, the study analyzed different MCI response regimes in Lahore, Pakistan, that vary in terms of the level of casualty-load distribution and the required coordination between the incident site and the responding hospitals. Past terrorist attacks in this major metropolitan area were considered to set up experiments for comparing delays in treatment under the modeled regimes. The analysis highlights that the number of casualties that are allowed to queue up at the nearest hospital before diverting the casualty traffic to an alternate hospital can be an important factor in reducing the overall treatment delays. Prematurely diverting the casualty traffic from the incident site to an alternate hospital can increase the travel time, while a delay in diversion can overload the nearest hospital, which can lead to overall longer waiting times in the queue. The casualty distribution mechanisms based only on the responding hospitals’ available capacity and current load can perform inefficiently because they overlook the trade-off between the times casualties spend in traveling and in queues. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 14:25:57,,364-377,,3,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Casualty distribution; Emergency response; Mass casualty incidents; Pakistan; Urban terrorism; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Simio,0,,,,,,,,

This study investigates the impact of a set of operational policies on ICU behavior and performance. Specifically, the implemented policies are (a) wait time thresholds on how long patients can wait for an ICU bed, (b) the time windows during which patient discharges and transfers take place, and (c) different patient mix combinations. The average waiting time of patients for ICU beds and the admission ratio, the ratio of admitted patients to total ICU bed requests, are the performance measures under consideration. Using discrete event simulation, followed by analysis of variance and post hoc tests (Tukey multiple comparison), it is shown that increasing discharge windows has a statistically significant impact on the total number of admissions and average patient wait times. Moreover, average waiting time increased when wait time thresholds increased, especially when the number of emergency surgeries in the mix increased. In addition, larger proportions of elective surgery patients in the patient mix population can lead to significantly reduced ICU performance. © The Author(s) 2020.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 13:55:51,,501-518,,6,96,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete event simulation; access improvement; discharge window; Health care operations; intensive care unit; patient mix; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,AutoMod,0,,,,,,,,

In this sense, ECNs are called to provide a rapid diagnosis and early intervention so that poor patient outcomes, patient dissatisfaction, and cost overruns can be avoided. Nevertheless, ECNs, as nodal systems, are often inefficient due to the lack of coordination between emergency departments (EDs) and the presence of non-value added activities within each ED. This situation is even more complex in the public healthcare sector of low-income countries where emergency care is provided under constraint resources and limited innovation. Notwithstanding the tremendous efforts made by healthcare clusters and government agencies to tackle this problem, most of ECNs do not yet provide nimble and efficient care to patients. Additionally, little progress has been evidenced regarding the creation of methodological approaches that assist policymakers in solving this problem. In an attempt to address these shortcomings, this paper presents a three-phase methodology based on Discrete-event simulation, payment collateral models, and lean six sigma to support the design of in-time and economically sustainable ECNs. The proposed approach is validated in a public ECN consisting of 2 hospitals and 8 POCs (Point of Care). The results of this study evidenced that the average waiting time in an ECN can be substantially diminished by optimizing the cooperation flows between EDs.

Objectives: The objectives were to evaluate the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of nonbisphosphonates {denosumab [Prolia®; Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA], raloxifene [Evista®; Daiichi Sankyo Company, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan], romosozumab [Evenity®; Union Chimique Belge (UCB) S.A. (Brussels, Belgium) and Amgen Inc.] and teriparatide [Forsteo®; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA]}, compared with each other, bisphosphonates or no treatment, for the prevention of fragility fracture. Data sources: For the clinical effectiveness review, nine electronic databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) were searched up to July 2018. Review methods: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of fracture and femoral neck bone mineral density were conducted. A review of published economic analyses was undertaken and a model previously used to evaluate bisphosphonates was adapted. Discrete event simulation was used to estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years for a simulated cohort of patients with heterogeneous characteristics. This was done for each non-bisphosphonate treatment, a strategy of no treatment, and the five bisphosphonate treatments previously evaluated. The model was populated with effectiveness evidence from the systematic review and network meta-analysis. All other parameters were estimated from published sources. An NHS and Personal Social Services perspective was taken, and costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Fracture risk was estimated from patient characteristics using the QFracture® (QFracture-2012 open source revision 38, Clinrisk Ltd, Leeds, UK) and FRAX® (web version 3.9, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK) tools. The relationship between fracture risk and incremental net monetary benefit was estimated using non-parametric regression. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis and scenario analyses were used to assess uncertainty. Results: Fifty-two randomised controlled trials of non-bisphosphonates were included in the clinical effectiveness systematic review and an additional 51 randomised controlled trials of bisphosphonates were included in the network meta-analysis. All treatments had beneficial effects compared with placebo for vertebral, non-vertebral and hip fractures, with hazard ratios varying from 0.23 to 0.94, depending on treatment and fracture type. The effects on vertebral fractures and the percentage change in bone mineral density were statistically significant for all treatments. The rate of serious adverse events varied across trials (0-33%), with most between-group differences not being statistically significant for comparisons with placebo/no active treatment, non-bisphosphonates or bisphosphonates. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were > £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year for all non-bisphosphonate interventions compared with no treatment across the range of QFracture and FRAX scores expected in the population eligible for fracture risk assessment. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for denosumab may fall below £30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year at very high levels of risk or for high-risk patients with specific characteristics. Raloxifene was dominated by no treatment (resulted in fewer quality-adjusted life-years) in most risk categories. Limitations: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are uncertain for very high-risk patients. Conclusions: Non-bisphosphonates are effective in preventing fragility fractures, but the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are generally greater than the commonly applied threshold of £20,000-30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year.

The CBDM was initiated in 2013 as an essential public health service; however, the potential long-term impact of CBDM on cardiovascular (CV: CHD and stroke) events is unknown. The objective of the study was to understand the long-term impact of CBDM interventions on CV risk factors using disease-model simulation based on a single-arm experimental study. Methods: A discrete event simulation was developed to evaluate the impact of CBDM on the long-term CV risk among patients with hypertension, in China's Xin Jiang autonomous region. The model generated pairs of identical patients; one receives CBDM and one does not (control group). Their clinical courses were simulated based on time to CV events (CHD and strokes), which are estimated using published risk equations. The impact of CBDM was incorporated as improvement in systolic blood pressure (SBP) based on observations from the CBDM study. The simulation estimated the number of CV events over patients' lifetimes. Results: During a 2-year follow up, the CBDM led to an average reduction of 8.73 mmHg in SBP from baseline, and a 42% reduction in smoking. The discrete event simulation showed that, in the control group, the model estimated incidence rates of 276, 1789, and 616 per 100,000 individuals for lifetime CHD, stroke, and CV-related death, respectively. The impact of CBDM on SBP translated into reductions of 8, 28, and 23% in CHD, stroke, and CV-related deaths, respectively. Taking into account CBDM's reduction of both SBP and smoking, deaths from CHD, stroke, and CV-related deaths were reduced by 12, 30, and 26%, respectively. Conclusions: The implementation of CBDM in China's Xinjiang autonomous region is expected to significantly reduce incidences of CHD, strokes, and CV-related deaths. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 14:07:30,,,,1,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Stroke; Cardiovascular disease (CVD); Community-based disease management (CBDM); Congestive heart failure (CHD); Discrete-event simulation (DES) model; Hypertension; Myocardial infarction (MI); Yes,0,1,1,0,ISPOR,0,Excel,0,,,,,,Data available on request,,"""data"" available on request"

Simulation and optimization techniques can support management decisions to reduce the risk of the decision process by evaluating and analyzing various patient flow control strategies. The purpose of this study is to propose mathematical models and algorithmic frameworks to minimize the waiting time of patients and to determine the timing of the services of an emergency center. The patient scheduling problem is formulated as integer programming models, and the large instances of the problem are solved by Tabu search method and L-shaped algorithm. This cross-sectional descriptive study is conducted on 150 patients referred to the emergency department of a government hospital, and the required data are collected through a questionnaire.

Evaluation of personalized treatment options requires health economic models that include multiple patient characteristics. Patient-level discrete-event simulation (DES) models are deemed appropriate because of their ability to simulate a variety of characteristics and treatment pathways. However, DES models are scarce in the literature, and details about their methods are often missing. Methods. We describe 4 challenges associated with modeling heterogeneity and structural, stochastic, and parameter uncertainty that can be encountered during the development of DES models. We explain why these are important and how to correctly implement them. To illustrate the impact of the modeling choices discussed, we use (results of) a model for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a case study. Results. The results from the case study showed that, under a correct implementation of the uncertainty in the model, a hypothetical intervention can be deemed as cost-effective. The consequences of incorrect modeling uncertainty included an increase in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranging from 50% to almost a factor of 14, an extended life expectancy of approximately 1.4 years, and an enormously increased uncertainty around the model outcomes. Thus, modeling uncertainty incorrectly can have substantial implications for decision making. Conclusions. This article provides guidance on the implementation of uncertainty in DES models and improves the transparency of reporting uncertainty methods. The COPD case study illustrates the issues described in the article and helps understanding them better. The model R code shows how the uncertainty was implemented. For readers not familiar with R, the model’s pseudo-code can be used to understand how the model works. By doing this, we can help other developers, who are likely to face similar challenges to those described here. © The Author(s) 2020.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 14:04:26,,619-632,,5,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,COPD; discrete event simulation model; heterogeneity; patient-level model; personalized medicine; uncertainty; Yes,0,1,1,1,None,0,R,1,,Github,,,,,,Also included psuedo code in suppl online appendix

Setting Mathematical model. Methods We used discrete event simulation modeling to estimate the probability of HIV-TE in the first 8 weeks after ART initiation; we varied ART initiation from D0 to D28 after simulated “diagnosis”. The model inputs used sexual behavior parameters from the MSM population of the START trial, and transmission rates per-sex act and HIV-1 RNA from recent meta-analyses. HIV-1 RNA decay curves were modeled from the databases of Single (efavirenz [EFV] v dolutegravir [DTG]), Spring-2 (raltegravir [RAL] v DTG), and Flamingo (darunavir/ritonavir [DRVr] v DTG) trials. Results We found that the number of HIV-TE per index patient in the first 8 weeks after ART initiation increased linearly for same-day ART to initiation on day 28. Small but statistically significant advantages of integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI) over EFV and DRVr were found. Conclusions Rapid, if not same-day initiation of INSTI-based ART to newly diagnosed HIV-infected MSM has the potential for substantial public health benefits related to decreases in HIV-TE. © 2020 Berenguer et al.

We examine factors associated with waiting time estimation behaviour and how it can be linked to patient flow modelling. Using data from more than 250 patients, we evaluate machine learning (ML) methods to understand waiting time estimation behaviour in two emergency department areas. Our attribute ranking and selection methods reveal that actual waiting time, clinical attributes, and the service environment are among the top ranked and selected attributes. The classification precision for the true outcome of overestimating waiting times reaches almost 70% and 78% in the waiting area and the treatment room, respectively. We linked the ML results with a discrete-event simulation model. Our scenario analysis reveals that changing staffing patterns can lead to a substantial drop-off in overestimation of waiting times. These insights can be employed to control waiting time perceptions and, potentially, increase patient satisfaction. © 2019, © Operational Research Society 2019.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 14:25:29,,1087-1101,,7,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,machine learning; discrete-event simulation; attribute selection; classification; Waiting-time perceptions; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

Simulation is one approach used for understanding and assessing the likely impact of changes to the delivery of health services. However, little is known about the usefulness of simulation for analysing the delivery of sexual health services (SHSs). We propose a simulation method to model and evaluate patient flows and resource use within an SHS to inform service redesign. Methods We developed a discrete event simulation (DES) model to identify the bottlenecks within the Unity SHS (Bristol, UK) and find possible routes for service improvement. Using the example of the introduction of an online service for sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV self-sampling for asymptomatic patients, the impact on patient waiting times was examined as the main outcome measure. The model included data such as patient arrival time, staff availability and duration of consultation, examination and treatment. We performed several sensitivity analyses to assess uncertainty in the model parameters. Results We identified some bottlenecks under the current system, particularly in the consultation and treatment queues for male and female walk-in patients. Introducing the provision of STI and HIV self-sampling alongside existing services decreased the average waiting time (88 vs 128 min) for all patients and reduced the cost of staff time for managing each patient (£72.64 vs £88.74) compared with the current system without online-based self-sampling. Conclusions The provision of online-based STI and HIV self-sampling for asymptomatic patients could be beneficial in reducing patient waiting times and the model highlights the complexities of using this to cut costs. Attributing recognition for any improvement requires care, but DES modelling can provide valuable insights into the design of SHSs ensuing in quantifiable improvements. Extension of this method with the collection of additional data and the construction of more informed models seems worthwhile. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Using a simulation model, and the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) hospital as the problem setting, we compare alternative rules for dispatching the patient movers via a centralised, computer-controlled system. Included in the comparison is the rule used currently at the hospital as well as new alternative dispatching rules we develop for the study. Our results suggest that significant improvements in system performance can be obtained by using better dispatching rules that consider not only the proximity of the patient mover to the patient pick-up point but also the type of equipment needed (wheelchair versus gurney) and the location of the equipment marshalling areas, which also play a key role. In conjunction with the dispatching rules, we investigate the number and location of the marshalling areas, and show empirically that carefully locating them based on usage improves the system performance as much as, if not more than, a more efficient dispatching rule. Although the UMHS hospital serves as the problem setting, our study would apply to most hospitals with dedicated patient movers and centralised dispatching. © Operational Research Society 2018.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 11:31:52,,226-252,,3,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete-event simulation; Patient transport; patient-mover dispatching; process improvement; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Plant Simulation,0,,,,,,,,

Managers are usually forced to identify strategies and make decisions without effective knowledge of the actual state of processes or the impact of their decisions. However, the fact that (EDs) are run based on Medical Guidelines that define performance criteria targets contributing to delivering efficient management should be highlighted. Nonetheless, identifying improvement actions based on the criteria defined and making effective decisions is no easy task given the level of complexity of ED management environments. To this end, this paper introduces a Framework based on the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method with Discrete Event Simulation (DES) as support in devising improvement actions with a view to enhancing management performance for an ED that services patients covered by the Brazilian federal government's single healthcare system (Sistema Único de Saúde - SUS). Deploying the DEMATEL method enabled identifying the influential and important criteria in the criteria network used to run the patient care and treatment process management and, in their turn, devising improvement actions for the ED under study. In addition, in many cases, process specialists are unaware of the concrete impacts resulting from the implementation of these actions. Therefore, the proposed Framework incorporates knowledge of the DES to test the improvement actions through simulated scenarios. This new approach (DEMATEL-DES Framework) can help establish a system for the decision-making process that, in its turn, can support ED managers in making complex decisions. © 2020",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 11:27:35,,,,,146,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Framework; Discrete event simulation; Healthcare management; DEMATEL method; Emergency department; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,ProModel,0,,,,,,,,

Methods: We built a hybrid discrete event/agent-based simulation model to replicate a serious bacterial outbreak of resistant Escherichia coli in a large metropolitan public hospital during 2017. We tested the 3 strategies of using whole-genome sequencing early, late (actual outbreak), or not using it and assessed their associated outbreak size and hospital cost. The model included ward dynamics, pathogen transmission, and associated hospital costs during a 5-month outbreak. Model parameters were determined using data from the Queensland Hospital Admitted Patient Data Collection (N = 4809 patient admissions) and local clinical knowledge. Sensitivity analyses were performed to address model and parameter uncertainty. Results: An estimated 197 patients were colonized during the outbreak, with 75 patients detected. The total outbreak cost was A$460 137 (US$317 117), with 6.1% spent on sequencing. Without sequencing, the outbreak was estimated to result in 352 colonized patients, costing A$766 921 (US$528 547). With earlier detection from use of routine sequencing, the estimated outbreak size was 3 patients and cost A$65 374 (US$45 054). Conclusions: Using whole-genome sequencing in hospital outbreak management was associated with smaller outbreaks and cost savings, with sequencing costs as a small fraction of total hospital costs, supporting the further investigation of the use of routine whole-genome sequencing in hospitals. © 2020 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 13:43:47,,994-1002,,8,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,agent-based modeling; bacterial infectious disease; cost consequences; discrete event modeling; healthcare associated infections; Hybrid; Yes,0,1,1,1,None,0,Anylogic,0,,,,,Anylogic Cloud,,,https://cloud.anylogic.com/model/6fe44e5b-6276-44fd-95c8-ba93b3975262?mode=SETTINGS&tab=GENERAL  Same model used in 6PM698VX - this is actually documented via ODD but doesn't refererence other paper.

These tools were developed to support renal services in the South of England (the Wessex region caring for 650 dialysis patients), but are applicable elsewhere. A discrete-event simulation was used to model a worst case spread of COVID-19, to stress-test plans for dialysis provision throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigated the ability of the system to manage the mix of COVID-19 positive and negative patients, the likely effects on patients, outpatient workloads across all units, and inpatient workload at the centralised COVID-positive inpatient unit. A second Monte- Carlo vehicle routing model estimated the feasibility of patient transport plans. If current outpatient capacity is maintained there is sufficient capacity in the South of England to keep COVID-19 negative/recovered and positive patients in separate sessions, but rapid reallocation of patients may be needed. Outpatient COVID-19 cases will spillover to a secondary site while other sites will experience a reduction in workload. The primary site chosen to manage infected patients will experience a significant increase in outpatients and inpatients. At the peak of infection, it is predicted there will be up to 140 COVID-19 positive patients with 40 to 90 of these as inpatients, likely breaching current inpatient capacity. Patient transport services will also come under considerable pressure. If patient transport operates on a policy of one positive patient at a time, and two-way transport is needed, a likely scenario estimates 80 ambulance drive time hours per day (not including fixed drop-off and ambulance cleaning times). Relaxing policies on individual patient transport to 2-4 patients per trip can save 40-60% of drive time. In mixed urban/rural geographies steps may need to be taken to temporarily accommodate renal COVID-19 positive patients closer to treatment facilities. © 2020 Allen et al.

Blood is a vital, however limited resource in several treatments and surgeries. Unfortunately, people worldwide still die due to shortage in supply of requested blood products. In the same breath, expired (outdated) blood units is a medical waste such that its disposal is quite expensive to the healthcare industry, as well as environmentally unfriendly. Therefore, this research is inspired by the previous factors, and aimed at the satisfaction of blood demand whilst alleviating the outdating phenomenon of blood units. This deign has approached the discrete event simulation to model the inventory system of Al-Shifa Central Blood Bank (CBB) in Gaza city as a case study. O+ packed RBC and whole blood are the most problematic and challenging blood components among the other ones and therefore, this study is limited to them. The ultimate research objective is to identify the optimal daily inventory levels that minimize the outdating and shortage of blood units and their associated costs. Upon verifying and validating the underlying inventory model, it was obtained that the optimal target inventory level that minimizes and balances the outdating and shortage is 74.605 of packed RBC and whole blood units of the O+ blood type. © 2020 IEEE.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 15:08:25,,36-40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; Blood bank; Inventory; Packed RBC; Whole blood; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,

We consider a MSSP where elective and emergency patients can be treated in the same operating rooms. In addition to elective-dedicated operating room slots, flexible operating room slots are introduced to handle the fluctuating demand of emergency patients. To solve the MSSP, we propose a simulation-optimization approach consisting of a two-stage stochastic optimization model and a discrete-event simulation model. For the two-stage stochastic optimization model, uncertain arrivals of emergency patients are represented by discrete scenarios. The discrete-event simulation model is developed to address uncertainty related to the surgery duration and the length of stay at the hospital, and to test the Master Surgery Schedule (MSS) developed by the optimization model in a stochastic operational-level environment. In addition, the simulation model is used to generate scenarios for the optimization model. We present some general advice for surgery scheduling based on testing the optimization model in a numerical study. The simulation-optimization approach is applied to a case study from a hospital department that treats both elective and emergency patients. The optimized MSS outperforms the manually generated MSS, both in terms of emergency waiting time for surgery, and emergency interruptions to the flow of electives. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 15:07:26,,695-711,,2,285,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete-event simulation; OR in health services; Master Surgery Scheduling; Stochastic programming; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Matlab,0,,,,,,,,

We aimed to describe the characteristics of patients transported by the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and to investigate the surge capacity of and operational implications for the RFDS in dealing with COVID-19. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study. To determine the characteristics of patients transported for confirmed or suspected COVID-19, we included patient data from February 2, 2020, to May 6, 2020. To investigate the surge capacity and operational implications for the RFDS in dealing with COVID-19, we built and validated an interactive operations area-level discrete event simulation decision support model underpinned by RFDS air medical activity data from 2015 to 2019 (4 years). This model was subsequently used in a factorial in silico experiment to systematically investigate both the supply of RFDS air medical services and the increased rates of demand for these services for diseases of the respiratory system. Results: The RFDS conducted 291 patient episodes of care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19. This included 288 separate patients, including 136 men and 119 women (sex missing = 33), with a median age of 62.0 years (interquartile range, 43.5-74.9 years). The simulation decision support model we developed is capable of providing dynamic and real-time support for RFDS decision makers in understanding the system's performance under uncertain COVID-19 demand. With increased COVID-19–related demand, the ability of the RFDS to cope will be driven by the number of aircraft available. The simulation model provided each aviation section with estimated numbers of aircraft required to meet a range of anticipated demands. Conclusion: Despite the lack of certainty in the actual level of COVID-19–related demand for RFDS services, modeling demonstrates that the robustness of meeting such demand increases with the number of operational and medically staffed aircraft. © 2020 Air Medical Journal Associates",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 14:49:07,,404-409,,5,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Anylogic,0,,,,,,,,

If patients are unable to access this specialist resource, then death is a likely outcome. In appreciating these ‘capacity-dependent’ deaths, this paper reports on the clinically-led development of a stochastic discrete event simulation model designed to capture the key dynamics of the intensive care admissions process for COVID-19 patients. With application to a large public hospital in England during an early stage of the pandemic, the purpose of this study was to estimate the extent to which such capacity-dependent deaths can be mitigated through demand-side initiatives involving non-pharmaceutical interventions and supply-side measures to increase surge capacity. Based on information available at the time, results suggest that total capacity-dependent deaths can be reduced by 75% through a combination of increasing capacity from 45 to 100 beds, reducing length of stay by 25%, and flattening the peak demand to 26 admissions per day. Accounting for the additional ‘capacity-independent’ deaths, which occur even when appropriate care is available within the intensive care setting, yields an aggregate reduction in total deaths of 30%.

Reducing stroke symptom onset to reperfusion time is associated with improved functional outcomes. This study aims to develop a computational model to predict and identify time-related outcomes of community stroke calls within a geographic area based on variable parameters to support planning and coordination of ECR services. Methods: A discrete event simulation (DES) model to simulate and predict ECR service was designed using SimPy, a process-based DES framework written in Python. Geolocation data defined by the user, as well as that used by the model, were sourced using the Google Maps application programming interface. Variables were customized by the user on the basis of their local environment to provide more accurate prediction. Results: A DES model can estimate the delay between the time that emergency services are notified of a potential stroke and potential cerebral reperfusion using ECR at a capable hospital. Variables can be adjusted to observe the effect of modifying each parameter input. By varying the percentage of stroke patients receiving ECR, we were able to define the levels at which our existing service begins to fail in service delivery and assess the effect of adding centers. Conclusions: This novel computational DES model can aid the optimization of delivery of a stroke service within a city, state, or country. By varying geographic, population, and other user-defined inputs, the model can be applied to any location worldwide. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 14:03:35,,e400-e413,,,141,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Discrete event simulation; Acute ischemic stroke; Endovascular treatment; Google; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,SimPy,1,,,,,,,,

These create new heterogeneous challenges for society and healthcare systems. Congestion at acute hospitals has reached unprecedented levels due to the unavailability of acute beds. As a consequence, patients in need of treatment endure prolonged waiting times as a decision whether to admit, transfer, or send them home is made. These long waiting times often result in boarding patients in different places in the hospital. This threatens patient safety and diminishes the service quality while increasing treatment costs. It is argued in the extant literature that improved communication and enhanced patient flow is often more effective than merely increasing hospital capacity. Achieving this effective coordination is challenged by the uncertainties in care demand, the availability of accurate information, the complexity of inter-hospital dynamics and decision times. A hybrid simulation approach is presented in this paper, which aims to offer hospital managers a chance at investigating the patient boarding problem. Integrating ‘System Dynamic’ and ‘Discrete Event Simulation’ enables the user to ease the complexity of patient flow at both macro and micro levels. ‘Design of Experiment’ and ‘Data Envelopment Analysis’ are integrated with the simulation in order to assess the operational impact of various management interventions efficiently. A detailed implementation of the approach is demonstrated on an emergency department (ED) and Acute Medical Unit (AMU) of a large Irish hospital, which serves over 50,000 patients annually. Results indicate that improving transfer rates between hospital units has a significant positive impact. It reduces the number of boarding patients and has the potential to increase access by up to 40% to the case study organization. However, poor communication and coordination, human factors, downstream capacity constraints, shared resources and services between units may affect this access. Furthermore, an increase in staff numbers is required to sustain the acceptable level of service delivery. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 11:11:49,,,,,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Hybrid simulation; Acute medical assessment unit; Boarding patients; Data envelopment analysis; Healthcare management; Yes,0,1,1,0,STRESS,0,Anylogic,0,,,,,,Model available on request,,"Does not cite stress, but Appendix is a STRESS checklist."

For example, monitoring changes in variance or autocorrelation offers a computationally inexpensive method which can be used in real-time to assess when an infectious disease transitions to elimination. EWS have a promising potential to not only be used to monitor infectious diseases, but also to inform control policies to aid disease elimination. Previously, potential EWS have been identified for prevalence data, however the prevalence of a disease is often not known directly. In this work we identify EWS for incidence data, the standard data type collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or World Health Organization (WHO). We show, through several examples, that EWS calculated on simulated incidence time series data exhibit vastly different behaviours to those previously studied on prevalence data. In particular, the variance displays a decreasing trend on the approach to disease elimination, contrary to that expected from critical slowing down theory; this could lead to unreliable indicators of elimination when calculated on real-world data. We derive analytical predictions which can be generalised for many epidemiological systems, and we support our theory with simulated studies of disease incidence. Additionally, we explore EWS calculated on the rate of incidence over time, a property which can be extracted directly from incidence data. We find that although incidence might not exhibit typical critical slowing down properties before a critical transition, the rate of incidence does, presenting a promising new data type for the application of statistical indicators. © 2020 Southall et al.

In this research, we focus on triage targets and try to fully meet the target of fast emergency response for critical patients subject to triage requirements for other category patients by optimising the medical staff allocation in the emergency department. Main challenges stem from multiple stochastic constraints and the time-consuming simulation. To solve the stochastically constrained discrete optimisation via simulation problem, we develop a discrete-event simulation model and propose a simulated-annealing-based algorithm called ConSA that adopts a special searching mechanism and an efficient simulation budget allocation rule to find a high-quality configuration of medical staff. A case study based on the data from a public hospital in Hong Kong is carried out. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm leads to a 38.28% improvement in the main performance compared to the current staff allocation and dominates other algorithms in terms of computational efficiency and output accuracy. It indicates that our method is a good decision tool for hospital managers. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 11:16:16,,6004-6023,,19,58,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,discrete optimisation via simulation; healthcare management; medical resource allocation; simulated annealing; stochastic constraint; Yes,0,1,1,0,None,0,Arena,0,,,,,,,,Cited a 2016 study.

The impact of such changes in the workflow of AECs on throughput and other performance indicators is largely unknown, although a significant reduction in revenue stream is expected. Methods: A discrete event simulation–based model was developed in the setting of a small to medium community-based single-specialty AEC to quantify the impact of COVID-19–related workflow changes on performance indicators and cost per case compared with the pre–COVID-19 baseline. Results: In the simulation model, post–COVID-19 recommended workflow changes significantly impacted the operational and productivity metrics and, in turn, adversely affected financial metrics. Overall, there was a significant decrease in staff utilization and consequent increase in total facility time, waiting time for patients, and cost per case because of a bottleneck at the time of preprocedure COVID-19 screening and testing while practicing social distancing. Strategies to minimize this adverse impact on productivity were assessed. Conclusions: Pretesting and screening for COVID-19 as recommended by current guidelines will significantly impact the productivity and revenue stream of AECs. Urgent measures by payors are needed to adjust the facility reimbursement of endoscopy centers to ensure successful reopening and ramping up outpatient endoscopy services in these facilities already hit hard by the pandemic. © 2020 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy",2020,2022-10-26 15:47:36,2022-10-31 14:06:36,,914-924,,4,92,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Yes,0,1,1,0,None,1,Anylogic,0,,,,,,,,

Many facilities have limited capacity and increasing consultation time could result in a longer waiting time for patients and longer working hours for physicians. The use of simulation can be practical for quantifying the impact of workflow scenarios and guide the decision-making. Objective: To examine the impact of increasing consultation time on patient waiting time and physician working hours. Methods: Using discrete events simulation, we modeled the existing workflow and tested five different scenarios with a longer consultation time. In each scenario, we examined the impact of consultation time on patient waiting time, physician hours, and rate of staff utilization. Results: At baseline scenarios (5-minute consultation time), the average waiting time was 9.87 minutes and gradually increased to 89.93 minutes in scenario five (10 minutes consultation time). However, the impact of increasing consultation time on patients waiting time did not impact all patients evenly where patients who arrive later tend to wait longer. Scenarios with a longer consultation time were more sensitive to the patients' order of arrival than those with a shorter consultation time. Conclusion: By using simulation, we assessed the impact of increasing the consultation time in a risk-free environment. The increase in patients waiting time was somewhat gradual, and patients who arrive later in the day are more likely to wait longer than those who arrive earlier in the day. Increasing consultation time was more sensitive to the patients' order of arrival than those with a shorter consultation time. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

The project combines three interesting characteristics. First, we rely on ethnographic observation to explore the problem situation and frame the problem, a technique rarely reported in operational research (OR). Second, this leads us to define several root definitions, an aspect that remains overlooked in studies combining SSM and DES. Finally, the project stands at the interface between two departments (outpatient oncology unit and chemotherapy preparation pharmacy unit), a situation seldom explored in healthcare OR but where SSM has arguably a lot to offer to help identify and accommodate diverging objectives. We framed the problem, developed a simulation model, explored scenarios and refined a preferred one into a new business process. However, the proposed changes were not implemented. We analyse the outcomes of the project, the contribution of each method and their integration into an intervention.

Bed management is a key to the effective delivery of high quality and low-cost healthcare. The purpose of this paper is to develop a discrete event simulation to assist in planning and staff scheduling decisions. Design/methodology/approach: A discrete event simulation model was developed for a hospital system to analyze admissions, patient transfer, length of stay (LOS), waiting time and queue time. The hospital system contained 50 beds and four departments. The data used to construct the model were from five years of patient records and contained information on 23,019 patients. Each department’s performance measures were taken into consideration separately to understand and quantify the behavior of departments individually, and the hospital system as a whole. Several scenarios were analyzed to determine the impact on reducing the number of patients waiting in queue, waiting time and LOS of patients. Findings: Using the simulation model, it was determined that reducing the bed turnover time by 1 h resulted in a statistically significant reduction in patient wait time in queue. Further, reducing the average LOS by 10 h results in statistically significant reductions in the average patient wait time and average patient queue. A comparative analysis of department also showed considerable improvements in average wait time, average number of patients in queue and average LOS with the addition of two beds. Originality/value: This research highlights the applicability of simulation in healthcare. Through data that are often readily available in bed management tracking systems, the operational behavior of a hospital can be modeled, which enables hospital management to test the impact of changes without cost and risk. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2019,2022-10-26 15:47:32,2022-11-19 14:15:01,,499-515,,2,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,1,,,,"Appointments and Schedules;

A Simulation Model Based on Real Life Data.,Frontiers in neurology,,1664-2295,10.3389/fneur.2022.861259,,"BACKGROUND: This modeling study aimed to determine if helicopters may optimize the transportation of patients with symptoms of large vessel stroke in ""intermediate density"" areas, such as Denmark, by bringing them directly to the comprehensive stroke center. METHODS: We estimated the time for the treatment of patients requiring endovascular therapy or intravenous thrombolysis under four configurations: ""drip and ship"" with and without helicopter and ""bypass"" with and without helicopter. Time delays, stroke numbers per municipality, and helicopter dispatches for four helicopter bases from 2019 were obtained from the Danish Stroke and Helicopter Registries. Discrete event simulation (DES) was used to estimate the capacity of the helicopter fleet to meet patient transport requests, given the number of stroke codes per municipality. RESULTS: The median onset-to-needle time at the comprehensive stroke center (CSC) for the bypass model with the helicopter was 115 min [interquartile range (IQR): 108, 124]; the median onset-to-groin time was 157 min (IQR: 150, 166). The median onset-to-needle time at the primary stroke center (PSC) by ground transport was 112 min (IQR: 101, 125) and the median onset-to-groin time when primary transport to the PSC was prioritized was 234 min (IQR: 209, 261).A linear correlation between travel time by ground and the number of patients transported by helicopter (rho = 0.69, p < 0.001) indicated that helicopters are being used to transport more remote patients. DES demonstrated that an increase in helicopter capture zone by 20 min increased the number of rejected patients by only 5%. CONCLUSIONS: Our model calculations suggest that using helicopters to transport patients with stroke directly to the CSC in intermediate density areas markedly reduce onset-to-groin time without affecting time to thrombolysis. In this setting, helicopter capacity is not challenged by increasing the capture zone.",2022,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:26:54,,861259,,,13,,Front Neurol,,,,,,,,eng,"Copyright © 2022 Behrndtz, Beare, Iievlieva, Andersen, Mainz, Gude, Ma, Srikanth, Simonsen and Phan.",,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 35547365 PMCID: PMC9082641,,,,drip & ship; helicopter; Large-Vessel Occlusion; model; mothership; prehospital/EMS; rurban area; transport-air; Yesp,0,1,1,0,None,0,R Simmer,1,,,,,,,,

In the addressed RNN model, the delays occurring in the information interconnections are allowed to be different, and the phenomenon of sensor saturation is taken into consideration in the measurement model. A novel dynamic event-triggered protocol is employed in the data transmission from sensors to the observer with hope to improve the efficiency of resource utilization, where the threshold parameters are adaptive to the dynamical environment. By virtue of the Lyapunov-like approach, a general framework is established for examining the boundedness of the estimation errors in mean-square sense, and the ultimate bound of the error dynamics is also acquired. Subsequently, the explicit expression of the desired PIO is parameterized by using the matrix inequality techniques. Finally, a simulation example is utilized to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed PIO design scheme.",2020-11,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:56:45,,4619-4632,,11,50,,IEEE Trans Cybern,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 32078572,,,,Yesp,0,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,Not DES

Novel risk prediction tools - such as the PinPoint test - could help to reduce unnecessary clinic referrals. Using early data on the expected accuracy of the test, we explore the potential impact of PinPoint on: (a) the percentage of patients meeting the two-week referral target, and (b) the number of clinic 'overspill' appointments generated (i.e. patients having to return to the clinic to complete their required investigations). METHODS: A simulation model was built to reflect the annual flow of patients through a single UK clinic. Due to current uncertainty around the exact impact of PinPoint testing on standard care, two primary scenarios were assessed. Scenario 1 assumed complete GP adherence to testing, with only non-referred cancerous cases returning for delayed referral. Scenario 2 assumed GPs would overrule 20% of low-risk results, and that 10% of non-referred non-cancerous cases would also return for delayed referral. A range of sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of key uncertainties on the model results. Service reconfiguration scenarios, removing individual weekly clinics from the clinic schedule, were also explored. RESULTS: Under standard care, 66.3% (95% CI: 66.0 to 66.5) of patients met the referral target, with 1,685 (1,648 to 1,722) overspill appointments. Under both PinPoint scenarios, > 98% of patients met the referral target, with overspill appointments reduced to between 727 (707 to 746) [Scenario 1] and 886 (861 to 911) [Scenario 2]. The reduced clinic demand was sufficient to allow removal of one weekly low-capacity clinic [N = 10], and the results were robust to sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: The findings from this early analysis indicate that risk prediction tools could have the potential to alleviate pressure on cancer clinics, and are expected to have increased utility in the wake of heightened pressures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is required to validate these findings with real world evidence; evaluate the broader clinical and economic impact of the test; and to determine outcomes and risks for patients deemed to be low-risk on the PinPoint test and therefore not initially referred.",2022-10-29,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:24:07,,1301,,1,22,,BMC Health Serv Res,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022.

We describe the implementation and validation of the model, then apply this framework as a case study to determine the impact of different decision-making approaches on the optimal sequence of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) and associated outcomes. METHODS: A patient-level discrete event simulation (DES) was used to model heterogeneity in disease trajectories and outcomes. The evaluation of DMT options was implemented through a Markov model representing the patient's disease; outcomes included lifetime costs and quality of life. The DES and Markov models underwent internal and external validation. Analyses of the optimal treatment sequence for each patient were based on several decision-making criteria. These treatment sequences were compared to current treatment guidelines. RESULTS: Internal validation indicated that model outcomes for natural history were consistent with the input parameters used to inform the model. Costs and quality of life outcomes were successfully validated against published reference models. Whereas each decision-making criterion generated a different optimal treatment sequence, cladribine tablets were the only DMT common to all treatment sequences. By choosing treatments on the basis of minimising disease progression or number of relapses, it was possible to improve on current treatment guidelines; however, these treatment sequences were more costly. Maximising cost-effectiveness resulted in the lowest costs but was also associated with the worst outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The model was robust in generating outcomes consistent with published models and studies. It was also able to identify optimal treatment sequences based on different decision criteria. This innovative modelling framework has the potential to simulate individual patient trajectories in the current treatment landscape and may be useful for treatment switching and treatment positioning decisions in RRMS.",2022-02,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:24:21,,892-908,,2,39,,Adv Ther,,,,,,,,eng,© 2021.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess initiatives to reduce psychiatric intensive care unit (PICU) out-of-area bed placements within a major healthcare system in South West England. METHODS: Discrete event computer simulation was used to model patient flow across the healthcare system's three PICUs. A scenario analysis was performed to estimate the impact of management plans to decrease admissions and length of stay. The amount of capacity required to minimise total cost was also considered. RESULTS: Without increasing in-area capacity, mean out-of-area bed requirement can be reduced by 25.6% and 19.1% respectively through plausible initiatives to decrease admissions and length of stay. Reductions of 34.7% are possible if both initiatives are employed. Adjusting the in-area bed capacity can also lead to aggregate cost savings. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the likely effectiveness of particular initiatives in reducing out-of-area placements for high-acuity bedded psychiatric care. This study also demonstrates the value of computer simulation in an area that has seen little such attention to date.",2022-06-29,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:41:34,,1-9,,,,,J Ment Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 35766323,,,,computer simulation; psychiatric intensive care; Systems modelling; Yesp,0,1,1,0,None,0,PathSimR,1,,,,,,,,"Partially open.

METHODS: This investigation was conducted using whole-hospital, resource-constrained, patient-based, stochastic, discrete-event, simulation models of a generic 200-bed urban U.S. tertiary hospital serving routine emergency and COVID-19 patients. Systematically designed numerical experiments were conducted to provide generalizable insights into how hospital functionality may be affected by the care of COVID-19 pandemic patients along specially designated care paths, under changing pandemic situations, from getting ready to turning all of its resources to pandemic care. RESULTS: Several insights are presented. For example, each day of reduction in average ICU length of stay increases intensive care unit patient throughput by up to 24% for high COVID-19 daily patient arrival levels. The potential of 5 specific interventions and 2 critical shifts in care strategies to significantly increase hospital capacity is also described.

The present study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the guideline statin-initiation strategy and alternative strategies. METHODS: A decision analytic model using discrete event simulation with event probabilities based on a validated ASCVD risk prediction tool for Chinese was constructed. Risk factor inputs were from the dataset of a nationally representative survey of middle-aged and elderly Chinese. Data of statin treatment effectiveness were from a published meta-analysis. Other key input data were identified from the literature or relevant databases. The strategies we evaluated were the guideline strategy, a 15% 10-year risk threshold strategy and a 20% 10-year risk threshold strategy. After excluding any extended dominance strategies, the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of each strategy was calculated. RESULTS: The 20% 10-year risk threshold strategy was an extended dominance option. The incremental costs per QALY gained from the 15% 10-year risk threshold strategy compared with no treatment and the guideline strategy compared with the 15% 10-year risk threshold strategy were CN¥69,309 and CN¥154,944, respectively.

We compared the impact of ART regimens that include dolutegravir (DTG), raltegravir (RAL), efavirenz (EFV), or darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r), in treatment naïve men who have sex with men (MSM) on the probability of HIV-1 sexual transmission events (HIV-TE). SETTING: Mathematical model. METHODS: We used discrete event simulation modeling to estimate HIV-TE during the first 8 weeks after initiation of ART. HIV-1 RNA decay in men was modeled from the databases of three clinical trials: Single (DTG vs. EFV), Spring-2 (DTG vs. RAL) and Flamingo (DTG vs. DRV/r). RESULTS: All regimens substantially reduced the number of HIV-TE compared to no treatment. DTG led to fewer HIV-TE than its comparator in each of the three trials: 22.72% fewer transmissions than EFV; 0.52% fewer transmissions than RAL; and 38.67% fewer transmissions than DRV/r. The number of patients needed to treat with DTG to prevent one transmission event instead of comparator was 48 vs EFV, 2,194 vs RAL, and 31 vs DRV/r. CONCLUSION: Unsurprisingly, this mathematical model showed that all regimens reduced HIV-TE compared to no treatment. The results also suggest that that initial use of INSTIs, by virtue of their superior viral decay kinetics, have the potential to reduce HIV-1 horizontal transmission following initiation of ART in naïve MSM.

We aimed to evaluate the workflow times when utilizing a direct-to-angiography suite (DTAS) pathway for patients with suspected stroke presenting at a comprehensive stroke center compared with a conventional CT pathway. METHODS: We developed a discrete-event simulation (DES) model to evaluate DTAS workflow timelines compared with a conventional CT pathway, varying the admission NIHSS score treatment eligibility criteria. Model parameters were estimated based on 2 year observational data from our institution. Sensitivity analyses of simulation parameters were performed to assess the impact of patient volume and baseline utilization of angiography suites on workflow times utilizing DTAS. RESULTS: Simulation modeling of stroke patients (SimStroke) demonstrated door-to-reperfusion time savings of 0.2-3.5 min (p=0.05) for a range of DTAS eligibility criteria (ie, last known well to arrival <6 hours and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≥6-11), when compared with the conventional stroke care pathway. Sensitivity analyses revealed that DTAS time savings is highly dependent on baseline utilization of angiography suites. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the SimStroke model showed comparable time intervals for door-to-reperfusion for DTAS compared with a conventional stroke care pathway. However, the DTAS pathway was very sensitive to baseline angiography suite utilization, with even a 10% increase eliminating the advantages of DTAS compared with the conventional pathway.

To guide the design of such single-arm trials, expert groups published recommendations for clinically meaningful outcomes. The aim of this study was to quantitatively verify the appropriateness of these recommendations. METHODS: We used a discrete event simulation framework in combination with a supercomputer to find the required efficacy at which a NT can compete with ERC when it comes to quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE). In total, 24 different efficacy thresholds (including the recommendations) were investigated. RESULTS: After ascertaining face validity with content experts, repeated verification, external validation, and calibration we considered our model valid. Both recommendations rarely showed an incremental benefit of the NT over ERC. In the most optimistic scenario, an increase in the IBCG recommendation by 10% and an increase in the FDA/AUA recommendation by 5% would yield results at which a NT could compete with ERC from a QALE perspective. CONCLUSIONS: This simulation study demonstrated that the current recommendations regarding clinically meaningful outcomes for single-arm trials evaluating the efficacy of NT in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC may be too low. Based on our quantitative approach, we propose increasing these thresholds to at least 45%-55% at 6 months and 35% at 18-24 months (complete response rates/recurrence-free survival) to promote the development of clinically truly meaningful NT.",2020-05,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 15:05:43,,3287-3296,,10,9,,Cancer Med,,,,,,,,eng,© 2020 The Authors.

This study presents an application of an STM focusing on methods to evaluate the postprogression transition and its impact on survival predictions. METHODS: Data from the lenalidomide plus dexamethasone arm of the ASPIRE trial was used to estimate transition rates for an STM. The model accounted for the competing risk between the progression and preprogression death events and included an explicit structural link between the time to progression and subsequent death. The modeled transition rates were used to simulate individual disease trajectories in a discrete event simulation framework, based on which progression-free survival and overall survival over a 30-year time horizon were estimated. Survival predictions were compared with the observed trial data, matched external data, and estimates obtained from a more conventional partitioned survival analysis approach. RESULTS: The rates of progression and preprogression death were modeled using piecewise exponential functions. The rate of postprogression mortality was modeled using an exponential function accounting for the nonlinear effect of the time to progression. The STM provided survival estimates that closely fitted the trial data and gave more plausible long-term survival predictions than the best-fitting Weibull model applied in a partitioned survival analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The fit of the STM suggested that the modeled transition rates accurately captured the underlying disease process over the modeled time horizon.

The aim of this analysis was to use resource modeling to explore the effects of the uptake of first-line treatment with daratumumab on wait lists and wait times in patients with untreated multiple myeloma. Two formulations were compared: the standard IV formulation (DARA-IV) and a recently approved SC formulation (DARA-SC). METHODS: First, semi-structured interviews at six oncologic centers were used to retrieve data on the management of patients given a DARA-IV regimen. Second, a discrete event simulation (DES) model was built to estimate the effects on resource consumption, wait lists, and wait times in scenarios with different incident numbers of patients treated with either DARA-IV or DARA-SC. FINDINGS: In all of the simulated scenarios with more incident patients initiated on first-line treatment with DARA-IV, the actual capacity of infusion chairs was not enough to meet the demand, leading to increases in wait times and wait lists. In the highest-demand scenario, 17 more infusion chairs per center would be required to avoid such increases. Treatment with DARA-SC would allow centers to meet the demand with their actual capacity. IMPLICATIONS: DES modeling can effectively be used to formally explore the effects of different formulations on the use of limited resources, wait lists, and wait times at the facility level. Based on the findings from this analysis, DARA-SC may free up resources and prevent short- and long-term costs to infusion centers.",2022-10-01,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 15:11:54,,S0149-2918(22)00320-4,,,,,Clin Ther,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2022.

National audit data have shown that treatment provision is suboptimal. OBJECTIVES: The aims were to (1) determine the content, clinical effectiveness and day 90 cost-effectiveness of an enhanced paramedic assessment designed to facilitate thrombolysis delivery in hospital and (2) model thrombectomy service configuration options with optimal activity and cost-effectiveness informed by expert and public views. DESIGN: A mixed-methods approach was employed between 2014 and 2019. Systematic reviews examined enhanced paramedic roles and thrombectomy effectiveness. Professional and service user groups developed a thrombolysis-focused Paramedic Acute Stroke Treatment Assessment, which was evaluated in a pragmatic multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial and parallel process evaluation. Clinicians, patients, carers and the public were surveyed regarding thrombectomy service configuration. A decision tree was constructed from published data to estimate thrombectomy eligibility of the UK stroke population. A matching discrete-event simulation predicted patient benefits and financial consequences from increasing the number of centres. SETTING: The paramedic assessment trial was hosted by three regional ambulance services (in north-east England, north-west England and Wales) serving 15 hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 103 health-care representatives and 20 public representatives assisted in the development of the paramedic assessment. The trial enrolled 1214 stroke patients within 4 hours of symptom onset. Thrombectomy service provision was informed by a Delphi exercise with 64 stroke specialists and neuroradiologists, and surveys of 147 patients and 105 public respondents. INTERVENTIONS: The paramedic assessment comprised additional pre-hospital information collection, structured hospital handover, practical assistance up to 15 minutes post handover, a pre-departure care checklist and clinician feedback. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients receiving thrombolysis. Secondary outcomes included day 90 health (poor status was a modified Rankin Scale score of > 2). Economic outputs reported the number of cases treated and cost-effectiveness using quality-adjusted life-years and Great British pounds. DATA SOURCES: National registry data from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme and the Scottish Stroke Care Audit were used. REVIEW METHODS: Systematic searches of electronic bibliographies were used to identify relevant literature. Study inclusion and data extraction processes were described using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. RESULTS: The paramedic assessment trial found a clinically important but statistically non-significant reduction in thrombolysis among intervention patients, compared with standard care patients [197/500 (39.4%) vs. 319/714 (44.7%), respectively] (adjusted odds ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.08; p = 0.15). The rate of poor health outcomes was not significantly different, but was lower in the intervention group than in the standard care group [313/489 (64.0%) vs. 461/690 (66.8%), respectively] (adjusted odds ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 1.2; p = 0.39). There was no difference in the quality-adjusted life-years gained between the groups (0.005, 95% confidence interval –0.004 to 0.015), but total costs were significantly lower for patients in the intervention group than for those in the standard care group (–£1086, 95% confidence interval –£2236 to –£13). It has been estimated that, in the UK, 10,140–11,530 patients per year (i.e. 12% of stroke admissions) are eligible for thrombectomy. Meta-analysis of published data confirmed that thrombectomy-treated patients were significantly more likely to be functionally independent than patients receiving standard care (odds ratio 2.39, 95% confidence interval 1.88 to 3.04; n = 1841). Expert consensus and most public survey respondents favoured selective secondary transfer for accessing thrombectomy at regional neuroscience centres. The discrete-event simulation model suggested that six new English centres might generate 190 quality-adjusted life-years (95% confidence interval –6 to 399 quality-adjusted life-years) and a saving of £1,864,000 per year (95% confidence interval –£1,204,000 to £5,017,000 saving per year). The total mean thrombectomy cost up to 72 hours was £12,440, mostly attributable to the consumables. There was no significant cost difference between direct admission and secondary transfer (mean difference –£368, 95% confidence interval –£1016 to £279; p = 0.26). LIMITATIONS: Evidence for paramedic assessment fidelity was limited and group allocation could not be masked. Thrombectomy surveys represented respondent views only. Simulation models assumed that populations were consistent with published meta-analyses, included limited parameters reflecting underlying data sets and did not consider the capital costs of setting up new services. CONCLUSIONS: Paramedic assessment did not increase the proportion of patients receiving thrombolysis, but outcomes were consistent with improved cost-effectiveness at day 90, possibly reflecting better informed treatment decisions and/or adherence to clinical guidelines. However, the health difference was non-significant, small and short term. Approximately 12% of stroke patients are suitable for thrombectomy and widespread provision is likely to generate health and resource gains. Clinician and public views support secondary transfer to access treatment. FUTURE WORK: Further evaluation of emergency care pathways will determine whether or not enhanced paramedic assessment improves hospital guideline compliance. Validation of the simulation model post reconfiguration will improve precision and describe wider resource implications.

Our study assessed the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacogenomics panel for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, compared with usual care. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was employed using a discrete event simulation model. The microsimulation model aggregated the costs and benefits of genetically guided treatment versus usual care for 5000 simulated patients. The 10-year model combined data from various sources including genomic databases on prevalence of variants, population-level pharmaceutical claims on antiseizure medications, published long-term therapy retention rates, patient-level cost data, and systematic reviews. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was computed. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to address uncertainty in model parameters. RESULTS: The mean cost of the genetically guided treatment option was AU$98 199 compared with AU$95 386 for usual care. Corresponding mean QALYs were 4.67 compared with 4.28 for genetically guided and usual care strategies, respectively. The incremental cost per QALY gained was AU$7381. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the incremental cost per QALY gained was AU$6321 (95% uncertainty interval = AU$3604-AU$9621), with a 100% likelihood of being cost-effective in the Australian health care system. The most influential drivers of the findings were the monthly health care costs associated with reduced seizures, costs when seizures continued, and the quality-of-life estimates under genetically guided and usual care strategies. SIGNIFICANCE: This early economic evaluation of a pharmacogenomics panel to guide treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy could potentially be cost-effective in the Australian health care system.

The purpose of this study was to estimate long-term costs and health outcomes of recently diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes in Chile. METHODS: Cost and consequence study based on mathematical discrete event simulation (DES) model. We modelled expected costs (USD) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) from diagnosis to death (or the age of 95) of a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 incident cases, simulated based on the Chilean National Health Survey 2018. The incidence of twelve complications was estimated assuming the hazard functions provided by the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study. We explore heterogeneity across patients based on their baseline risk covariates and their impact on costs and QALYs. RESULTS: The expected cost and QALY of a recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes patient in Chile were USD 8660 and 12.44 QALYs. Both costs and QALYs were independently determined by baseline risk and the patient's life expectancy from the diagnosis. Length of life since diagnosis showed the major impact on costs (5.2% increase for every additional year). Myocardial infarction was the most frequent complication (47.4%) and the most frequent cause of death. CONCLUSION: Diabetes type 2 determines a significant expenditure of the health system and substantial health losses. Although the control of cardiovascular risk factors and the metabolic control of the disease, both have an important impact on costs and outcomes, the main impact is achieved by postponing the age of onset of the disease.",2022-10-26,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:43:28,,155,,1,14,,Diabetol Metab Syndr,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022.

Increasing demand for provision of care to stroke survivors creates challenges for health care planners. A key concern is the optimal alignment of health care resources between provision of acute care, rehabilitation, and among different segments of rehabilitation, including inpatient rehabilitation, early supported discharge (ESD), and outpatient rehabilitation (OPR). We propose a novel application of discrete event simulation (DES) combined with a genetic algorithm (GA) to identify the optimal configuration of rehabilitation that maximizes patient benefits subject to finite health care resources. Design. Our stroke rehabilitation optimal model (sROM) combines DES and GA to identify an optimal solution that minimizes wait time for each segment of rehabilitation by changing care capacity across different segments. sROM is initiated by generating parameters for DES. GA is used to evaluate wait time from DES. If wait time meets specified stopping criteria, the search process stops at a point at which optimal capacity is reached. If not, capacity estimates are updated, and an additional iteration of the DES is run. To parameterize the model, we standardized real-world data from medical records by fitting them into probability distributions. A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the likelihood of stroke survivors flowing across rehabilitation segments. Results. We predict that rehabilitation planners in Alberta, Canada, have the potential to improve services by increasing capacity from 75 to 113 patients per day for ESD and from 101 to 143 patients per day for OPR. Compared with the status quo, optimal capacity would provide ESD to 138 (s = 29.5) more survivors and OPR to 262 (s = 45.5) more annually while having an estimated net annual cost savings of $25.45 (s = 15.02) million. Conclusions. The combination of DES and GA can be used to estimate optimal service capacity. HIGHLIGHTS: We created a hybrid model combining a genetic algorithm and discrete event simulation to search for the optimal configuration of health care service capacity that maximizes patient outcomes subject to finite health system resources.We applied a probability distribution fitting process to standardize real-world data to probability distributions. The process consists of choosing the distribution type and estimating the parameters of that distribution that best reflects the data. Standardizing real-word data to a best-fitted distribution can increase model generalizability.In an illustrative study of stroke rehabilitation care, resource allocation to stroke rehabilitation services under an optimal configuration allows provision of care to more stroke survivors who need services while reducing wait time.Resources needed to expand rehabilitation services could be reallocated from the savings due to reduced wait time in acute care units. In general, the predicted optimal configuration of stroke rehabilitation services is associated with a net cost savings to the health care system.",2022-12,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:53:43,,2.38E+16,,2,7,,MDM Policy Pract,,,,,,,,eng,© The Author(s) 2022.,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 36310567 PMCID: PMC9597031,,,,discrete event simulation; distribution fit; genetic algorithm; health service planning; real-world data; stroke rehabilitation; Yesp,0,1,1,0,ISPOR,0,R Simmer,1,,,,,,,,

A discrete-event simulation model is used to estimate the frequency of movements between clinic units. The resulting information is utilised as input to a mixed integer programming (MIP) model, optimising the clinic layout design. In order to solve the MIP model, Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), a metaheuristic approach enhanced with several heuristics is utilised.

Unfortunately, the implementation of cost-effective prevention and control strategies has faced significant barriers, such as insufficient guidance on best practices for resource and operations planning. Therefore, we demonstrate the value of discrete event simulation (DES) in implementation science research and practice, particularly to support the programmatic and operational planning for sustainable and resilient delivery of healthcare interventions. Our specific example shows how DES models can inform planning for scale-up and resilient operations of a new HPV-based screen and treat program in Iquitos, an Amazonian city of Peru. METHODS: Using data from a time and motion study and cervical cancer screening registry from Iquitos, Peru, we developed a DES model to conduct virtual experimentation with ""what-if"" scenarios that compare different workflow and processing strategies under resource constraints and disruptions to the screening system. RESULTS: Our simulations show how much the screening system's capacity can be increased at current resource levels, how much variability in service times can be tolerated, and the extent of resilience to disruptions such as curtailed resources. The simulations also identify the resources that would be required to scale up for larger target populations or increased resilience to disruptions, illustrating the key tradeoff between resilience and efficiency. Thus, our results demonstrate how DES models can inform specific resourcing decisions but can also highlight important tradeoffs and suggest general ""rules"" for resource and operational planning. CONCLUSIONS: Multilevel planning and implementation challenges are not unique to sustainable adoption of cervical cancer screening programs but represent common barriers to the successful scale-up of many preventative health interventions worldwide. DES represents a broadly applicable tool to address complex implementation challenges identified at the national, regional, and local levels across settings and health interventions-how to make effective and efficient operational and resourcing decisions to support program adaptation to local constraints and demands so that they are resilient to changing demands and more likely to be maintained with fidelity over time.",2022-06-17,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:55:47,,65,,1,3,,Implement Sci Commun,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022.

METHODS: An Institutional Review Board approved retrospective review of time stamped data collection in a tertiary facility pediatric otolaryngology clinic. RESULTS: A discrete-event simulation was built from timestamps associated with clinic interaction milestones. The data were analyzed to develop standard clinic templates with the goal to reduce patient overall visit length by 10%. A total of 12,052 clinic visits were analyzed, 8,045 before (avg. of 62.9 visits/day) and 4,007 after (avg. of 65.7 visits/day) template standardization. The change led to a 10.5% (5.5 min, p < 0.001) decrease in total clinic visit time from 52.3 ± 25.9 min to 46.8 ± 25.0 min. This data extrapolated over a year is estimated to save 1,567 clinic hours. Secondarily, it was found that patient experience was not affected as a result of this change. CONCLUSION: Discrete-event simulation, using the principles of process improvement, is effective in guiding clinic operational redesign. This quality improvement project decreased the average length of clinic visit by 10% with no impact on historic high clinic volumes. Patient flow can improve in high volume pediatric otolaryngology practices by using process improvement strategies and discrete-event simulations to create standardized provider templates.

We set out to: 1) develop an operational model that accurately reflects tele-ICU workflows at baseline, 2) identify workflow changes that optimize operational efficiency through discrete-event simulation and multi-class priority queuing modeling, and 3) implement the predicted favorable workflow changes and validate the simulation model through prospective correlation of actual-to-predicted change in performance measures linked to patient outcomes. SETTING: Tele-ICU of a large healthcare system in New York State covering nine ICUs across the spectrum of adult critical care. PATIENTS: Seven-thousand three-hundred eighty-seven adult critically ill patients admitted to a system ICU (1,155 patients pre-intervention in 2016Q1 and 6,232 patients post-intervention 2016Q3 to 2017Q2). INTERVENTIONS: Change in tele-ICU workflow process structure and hierarchical process priority based on discrete-event simulation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Our discrete-event simulation model accurately reflected the actual baseline average time to first video assessment by both the tele-ICU intensivist (simulated 132.8 ± 6.7 min vs 132 ± 12.2 min actual) and the tele-ICU nurse (simulated 128.4 ± 7.6 min vs 123 ± 9.8 min actual). For a simultaneous priority and process change, the model simulated a reduction in average TVFA to 51.3 ± 1.6 min (tele-ICU intensivist) and 50.7 ± 2.1 min (tele-ICU nurse), less than the added simulated reductions for each change alone, suggesting correlation of the changes to some degree. Subsequently implementing both changes simultaneously resulted in actual reductions in average time to first video assessment to values within the 95% CIs of the simulations (50 ± 5.5 min for tele-intensivists and 49 ± 3.9 min for tele-nurses). CONCLUSIONS: Discrete-event simulation can accurately predict the effects of contemplated multidisciplinary tele-ICU workflow changes.

We describe a hybrid modeling approach to evaluate whole genome sequencing of pathogens for improving clinical decisions during a 2017 hospital outbreak of OXA-181 carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli and the associated economic effects. METHODS: Combining agent-based and discrete-event paradigms, we built a hybrid simulation model to assess hospital ward dynamics, pathogen transmission and colonizations. The model was calibrated to exactly replicate the real-life outcomes of the outbreak at the ward-level. Seven scenarios were assessed including genome sequencing (early or late) and no sequencing (usual care). Model inputs included extent of microbiology and sequencing tests, patient-level data on length of stay, hospital ward movement, cost data and local clinical knowledge. The main outcomes were outbreak size and hospital costs. Model validation and sensitivity analyses were performed to address uncertainty around data inputs and calibration. RESULTS: An estimated 197 patients were colonized during the outbreak with 75 patients detected. The total outbreak cost was US$318,654 with 6.1% of total costs spent on sequencing. Without sequencing, the outbreak was estimated to result in 352 colonized patients costing US$531,109. Microbiology tests were the largest cost component across all scenarios.

METHODS: The model was based on prospective observations and retrospective review of ED processes during the maintenance phase of the QI initiative between January 2016 and June 2017 in a large, urban, academic children's hospital in New York City, USA. We compared waiting time for full evaluation (WT) and length of stay (LOS) between a model with and a model without the protocol. We then gradually increased the proportion of patients receiving the protocol in the model and recorded changes in WT and LOS. RESULTS: We validated model outputs against administrative data from 2016, with no statistically significant differences in average WT or LOS for any emergency severity index (ESI). There were no statistically significant differences in these flow metrics between the model with and the model without the protocol. By increasing the proportion of total patients receiving this protocol, from 0.2% to 1.3%, the WT increased by 2.8 min (95% CI: 0.6 to 5.0) and 7.6 min (95% CI: 2.0 to 13.2) for ESI 2 and ESI 3 patients, respectively. This represents a 14.0% increase in WT for ESI 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Simulation modelling facilitated the testing of system effects for a time-specific protocol implemented in a large, urban, academic paediatric ED, showing no significant impact on patient flow.

Consequently, proper planning is required to establish the highest possible level of safety to both voters and scrutineers. In this paper, we present the novel and innovative way how the municipal council and district council elections in Vienna were planned and conducted using an discrete event simulation model. Key target of this process was to avoid queues in front of polling stations to reduce the risk of related infection clusters. In cooperation with a hygiene expert, we defined necessary precautions that should be met during the election in order to avoid the spread of COVID-19. In a next step, a simulation model was established and parametrized and validated using data from previous elections. Furthermore, the planned conditions were simulated to see whether excessive queues in front of any polling stations could form, as these could on the one hand act as an infection herd, and on the other hand, turn voters away. Our simulation identified some polling stations where long queues could emerge. However, splitting up these electoral branches resulted in a smooth election across all of Vienna. Looking back, the election did not lead to a significant increase of COVID-19 incidences.

In this analysis, 10-year health outcomes and health care costs of 1 year of the LABBPS intervention versus control are projected. METHODS: A discrete event simulation of hypertension care processes projected blood pressure, medication-related adverse events, fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease events, and noncardiovascular disease death in LABBPS participants. Program costs, total direct health care costs (2019 US dollars), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated for the LABBPS intervention and control arms from a health care sector perspective over a 10-year horizon. Future costs and QALYs were discounted 3% annually. High and intermediate cost-effectiveness thresholds were defined as <$50 000 and <$150 000 per QALY gained, respectively. RESULTS: At 10 years, the intervention was projected to cost an average of $2356 (95% uncertainty interval, -$264 to $4611) more per participant than the control arm and gain 0.06 (95% uncertainty interval, 0.01-0.10) QALYs. The LABBPS intervention was highly cost-effective, with a mean cost of $42 717 per QALY gained (58% probability of being highly and 96% of being at least intermediately cost-effective). Exclusive use of generic drugs improved the cost-effectiveness to $17 162 per QALY gained. The LABBPS intervention would be only intermediately cost-effective if pharmacists were less likely to intensify antihypertensive medications when systolic blood pressure was ≥150 mm Hg or if pharmacist weekly time driving to barbershops increased.

We studied the effect of incorporating postoperative departments in the decision process with regard to scheduling ORs and developed an integrated OR planning methodology that determines an optimal surgery sequence and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) nursing staff level, with the objective to level the variability in inflow of patients in the PACU. DESIGN: We developed an integrated OR planning methodology that investigates the sequencing of a surgical suite process with multiple ORs and postoperative hospital facilities. METHODS: This research was performed by representing a discrete-time two-stage flow shop problem. A retrospective study was performed in which the derived model was validated using discrete-event simulation. FINDINGS: Simulation results show that applying the integrated planning methodology decreased the variability in bed demand and smoothed the workload for the nursing staff in the PACU.

This understanding is not mature yet and there are wide areas of possible improvement. In particular, the fast mobilization and reconfiguration of resources frequently result into the severe disruption of elective activities, worsening the quality of care. This becomes particularly evident during the on-going coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. More resilient resource allocation strategies, that is, which adapt to the dynamics of the prevailing circumstance, are needed to maximize the effectiveness of health-care delivery. In this study, a simulation approach was adopted to assess and compare different hospital's adaptive resource allocation strategies in responding to a sudden onset disaster mass casualty incident (MCI). METHODS: A specific set of performance metrics was developed to take into consideration multiple objectives and priorities and holistically assess the effectiveness of health-care delivery when coping with an MCI event. Discrete event simulation (DES) and system dynamics (SD) were used to model the key hospital processes and the MCI plan. RESULTS: In the daytime scenario, during the recovery phase of the disaster, a gradual disengagement of resources from the emergency department (ED) to restart ordinary activities in operating rooms and wards returned the best performance. In the night scenario, the absorption capacity of the ED was evaluated by identifying the current bottleneck and assessment of the benefit of different resource mobilization strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The present study offers a robust approach, effective strategies and new insights to design more resilient plans to cope with MCIs. It becomes particularly relevant when considering the risk of indirect damage of emergencies, where all the available resources are shifted from the care of the ordinary to the ""disaster"" patients, like during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To assess EP lab utilization associated with cryoballoon ablation for the treatment of patients with PsAF and to evaluate mechanisms that optimize hospital resources. METHODS: Procedural data derived from the STOP Persistent AF trial were input into a discrete event simulation to assess EP lab utilization during AF ablation procedures. Patient and physician delays and lab occupancy times were modeled in a nominal and efficient EP lab setting over 1000 days. Accounting for variation in procedural times, we evaluated the number of days in which preplanned pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) cases resulted in overtime or excess time for non-ablation EP cases within a given lab day. A sensitivity analysis determined the parameters that most strongly influenced EP lab throughput. RESULTS: Lab occupancy times for the Nominal Use (NU) case included 165 procedures, and the High-Efficiency Use (HEU) case was derived from 69 procedures conducted at sites with faster procedure times than average. The HEU case had shorter lab occupancy times than the NU case (158 ± 32 minutes vs 188 ± 51 minutes, respectively). In the NU case, a total of 2000 procedures were conducted, with 28 lab days (2.8%) extending into overtime and 900 lab days (90%) exhibiting excess time for a non-ablation EP case. In the HEU case, a total of 3000 procedures were conducted, with 87 lab days (8.7%) extending into overtime and 635 lab days (63.5%) exhibiting excess time for a non-ablation EP case.

Deployment of traditional methods such as Lean and Six Sigma helped in reducing the waste in workflows at a strategic level. However, achieving efficient workflow needs both strategic and tactical approaches. Uncertainties about patient arrivals, staff availability, and variability in procedure durations pose hindrances to efficient workflow and lead to delayed patient care and staff overtime. We present an alternative approach to address both tactical and strategic needs using discrete event simulation (DES) and simulation based optimization methods. A comprehensive digital model of the patient workflow in a hospital-based IR department was modeled based on expert interviews with the incumbent personnel and analysis of 192 days' worth of electronic medical record (EMR) data. Patient arrival patterns and process times were derived from 4393 individual patient appointments. Exactly 196 unique procedures were modeled, each with its own process time distribution and rule-based procedure-room mapping. Dynamic staff schedules for interventional radiologists, technologists, and nurses were incorporated in the model. Stochastic model simulation runs revealed the resource ""computed tomography (CT) suite"" as the major workflow bottleneck during the morning hours. This insight compelled the radiology department leadership to re-assign time blocks on a diagnostic CT scanner to the IR group. Moreover, this approach helped identify opportunities for additional appointments at times of lower diagnostic scanner utilization. Demand for interventional service from Outpatients during late hours of the day required the facility to extend hours of operations. Simulation-based optimization methods were used to model a new staff schedule, stretching the existing pool of resources to support the additional 2.5 h of daily operation. In conclusion, this study illustrates that the combination of workflow modeling, stochastic simulations, and optimization techniques is a viable and effective approach for identifying workflow inefficiencies and discovering and validating improvement options through what-if scenario testing.",2021-02,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:45:00,,75-84,,1,34,,J Digit Imaging,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 33236295 PMCID: PMC7887149,,,,"*Radiology Department, Hospital; *Radiology, Interventional; Appointments and Schedules; Computer Simulation; Discrete event simulation; Efficiency, Organizational; Humans; Interventional radiology department; Operational improvement; Optimization; Simulation; Simulation-based optimization; What-if scenario analysis; Workflow; Workflow modeling; Yesp",0,1,1,0,None,0,Flexsim,0,,,,,,,,

These rare events can affect dynamics discretely in such a way that they cannot be evaluated by a deterministic and continuous simulation. Stochastic models of such a system provide a more detailed understanding of these systems than existing deterministic models because they capture their behavior at a molecular level. Our research focuses on the development of a high performance parallel discrete event simulation environment, Neuron Time Warp (NTW), which is intended for use in the parallel simulation of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems such as intra-calcium signaling. NTW is integrated with NEURON, a simulator which is widely used within the neuroscience community. We simulate two models, a calcium buffer and a calcium wave model.

Radiotherapy pre-treatment workflow is driven by the scheduling of the first irradiation session, which is usually set right after consultation (pull strategy) or can alternatively be set after the pre-treatment workflow has been completed (push strategy). The objective of this study is to assess the impact of using pull and push strategies and explore alternative interventions for improving timeliness in radiotherapy. METHODS: Discrete-event simulation is used to model the patient flow of a large radiotherapy department of a Dutch hospital. A staff survey, interviews with managers, and historical data from 2017 are used to generate model inputs, in which fluctuations in patient inflow and resource availability are considered. RESULTS: A hybrid (40% pull / 60% push) strategy representing the current practice (baseline case) leads to 12% lower average waiting times and 48% fewer first appointment rebooks when compared to a full pull strategy, which in turn leads to 41% fewer patients breaching the waiting time targets. An additional scenario analysis performed on the baseline case showed that spreading consultation slots evenly throughout the week can provide a 21% reduction in waiting times. CONCLUSIONS: A 100% pull strategy allows for more patients starting treatment within the waiting time targets than a hybrid strategy, in spite of slightly longer waiting times and more first appointment rebooks.

Operating theatres are critical resources within hospitals that can become bottlenecks in patient flow during high demand conditions. There are substantial costs associated with running operating theatres that include keeping professional staff ready, maintaining operating theatres and equipment, environmental services and cleaning of operating theatres and recovery rooms, and these costs can increase if theatres are not used efficiently. In addition to cost, operating theatre inefficiency can result in surgery cancelations and delays, and eventually, poor patient outcomes, which can be exacerbated under the increase in demand. METHODS: The allocation of surgeries to operating theatres is explored using a simulation model for patients admitted to inpatient beds and sent for surgery. We proposed a discrete event simulation (DES) to model incoming flow to operating theatres of a major metropolitan hospital. We assessed how changing the configuration of surgery at the target hospital affects Key Performance Indicators relating to theatre efficiency. In particular, the model was used to assess impacts of six different scenarios by defining new/hypothetical theatre case-mix, opening and closing times of theatres, turnaround (changeover) time, and repurposing the theatres. Target performance metrics included theatre utilisation, pre-operative length-of-stay, average reclaimable time, the percentage of total theatre time in a year that could be reclaimed, and patient waiting time. A web-based application was developed that allows testing user-defined scenarios and interactive analysis of the results. RESULTS: Extending the opening hours of operating theatres by 1 hour almost halved the number of deferred electives as well as over-run cases but at the expense of reduced theatre utilisation. A one-hour reduction in opening hours resulted in 10 times more deferred elective cases and a negligible increase in theatre utilisation. Reducing turnaround time by 50% had positive effects on theatre management: increased utilisation and less deferred and over-run elective cases. Pooling emergency theatres did not affect theatre utilisation but resulted in a considerable reduction in average wait time and the proportion of the delayed emergency cases. CONCLUSIONS: The developed DES-based simulation model of operating theatres along with the web-based user interface provided a useful interrogation tool for theatre management and hospital executive teams to assess new operational strategies. The next step is to embed simulation as ongoing practices in theatre planning workflow, allowing operational managers to use the model outputs to increase theatre utilisation, and reduce cancellations and schedule changes. This can support hospitals in providing services as efficiently and effectively as possible.",2022-10-21,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:16:57,,,,,,,Int J Health Plann Manage,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022 Commonwealth of Australia.

METHODS: The main approach used in this study was discrete-event simulation using the Arena software application. Moreover, the average waiting time (considering patients' lateness) and the number of missed patients (considering no-show and cancelled patients) were accounted for in the performance evaluation criteria for both of the selected policies. RESULTS: When the patients' arrival rate was high, the double-booking system resulted in higher productivity, while when it was low, the walk-in admission policy was the best policy for patient admission. The successful appointment rates of the current system, the walk-in admission system, and the double-booking system were 61.18%, 89.45%, and 93.24%, respectively.

A variety of different scenarios were investigated to determine the effects of increasing capacity, increasing demand, and reduction of proportion and length of delayed transfer of care out of the ICU. SETTING: Combined data from two ICUs in United Kingdom. PATIENTS: The model was developed using 1,728 patient records and was validated against an independent dataset of 2,650 patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During model validation, the average bed utilization and admittance rate were equal to the real-world data. In the what-if scenarios, we found that increasing bed numbers from 23 to 28 keeping the arrival rate stable reduces the average occupancy rate to 70%. We found that the projected 4% yearly increase in admissions could overwhelm even the 28-bedded unit, without change in the delayed transfer of care episodes. Reduction in the proportion of patients experiencing delayed transfer of care had the biggest effect on occupancy rates, time spent at full capacity, and average bed utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Using discrete-event simulation of commonly available baseline patient flow and patient care data produces reproducible models. Reducing the proportion of patients with delayed transfer of care had a greater effect in reducing occupancy levels than simply increasing bed numbers even when demand is increased.",2020-09,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:34:32,,e0174,,9,2,,Crit Care Explor,,,,,,,,eng,"Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

A careful approach to optimization of this complex system is needed because any change can result in unexpected deleterious effects. One such approach is discrete event simulation, in which what-if scenarios allow researchers to predict the impact of a proposed change on the system. However, studies illustrating the application of simulation in optimization of general internal medicine (GIM) team inpatient operations are lacking. METHODS: Administrative data about admissions and discharges, data from a time-motion study, and expert opinion on workflow were used to construct the simulation model. Then, the impact of four changes: aligning medical teams with nursing units, adding a hospitalist team, adding a nursing unit, and adding both a nursing unit and hospitalist team with higher admission volume were modeled on key hospital operational metrics. RESULTS: Aligning medical teams with nursing units improved team metrics for aligned teams but shifted patients to unaligned teams. Adding a hospitalist team had little benefit, but adding a nursing unit improved system metrics. Both adding a hospitalist team and a nursing unit would be required to maintain operational metrics with increased patient volume. CONCLUSION: Using simulation modeling, we provided data on the implications of four possible strategic changes on GIM inpatient units, providers, and patient throughput. Such analyses may be a worthwhile investment to study strategic decisions and make better choices with fewer unintended consequences.",2019-01-08,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:56:31,,9-15,,1,14,,J Hosp Med,,,,,,,,eng,© 2018 Society of Hospital Medicine.,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 30534642,,,,"*Computer Simulation; *Forecasting; *Internal Medicine; Efficiency, Organizational; Female; Hospitalists/statistics & numerical data; Hospitals/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Male; Patient Admission/statistics & numerical data; Patient Care Team/statistics & numerical data; Patient Discharge/statistics & numerical data; Time and Motion Studies; Yesp",0,1,1,0,None,0,Simul8,0,,,,,,,,"Provides instructions for building a DES model in Simul8, but not hte model itself."

We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of aripiprazole ODT vs. aripiprazole standard oral tablet (SOT), as well as olanzapine SOT in China. METHODS: We developed a discrete event simulation model from government payers' perspective. On the entry, 100,000 patients in each group were simulated for relapse, adverse events, changing adherence level, medication discontinuation, switching or quitting in response to three different medication adherence levels. The model projected quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and treatment costs over a 1-year time horizon. Parameter uncertainties were assessed through sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The QALYs per patient over 1-year treatment with aripiprazole ODT, aripiprazole SOT, or olanzapine SOT, were 0.7282, 0.7112, and 0.7218, respectively. The corresponding costs were $1,423, $2,215, and $1,493. In both comparisons, aripiprazole ODT was dominant.

Methods: A discrete event simulation (DES) model was developed to simulate the long-term outcome post EVT in patients meeting or not meeting the extended time window clinical trial perfusion imaging criteria at presentation, vs. medical treatment alone (including intravenous thrombolysis). The effectiveness of thrombectomy in patients meeting the landmark trial criteria (DEFUSE 3 and DAWN) was derived from a prospective cohort study of Australian patients who received EVT for ischemic stroke, between 2015 and 2019, in the extended time window (>4.5 h). Results: Endovascular thrombectomy was shown to be a cost-effective treatment for patients satisfying the clinical trial criteria in our prospective cohort [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $11,608/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for DEFUSE 3-postive or $34,416/QALY for DAWN-positive]. However, offering EVT to patients outside of clinical trial criteria was associated with reduced benefit (-1.02 QALY for DEFUSE 3; -1.43 QALY for DAWN) and higher long-term patient costs ($8,955 for DEFUSE 3; $9,271 for DAWN), thereby making it unlikely to be cost-effective in Australia. Conclusions: Treating patients not meeting the DAWN or DEFUSE 3 clinical trial criteria in the extended time window for EVT was associated with less gain in QALYs and higher cost.

AIM: To explore the cost-effectiveness of the RDC compared with standard clinical practice. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cost-effectiveness modelling using routine data from Neath Port Talbot Hospital, Wales. METHOD: Discrete-event simulation modelled a cohort of 1000 patients from referral to radiological diagnosis based on routine RDC and hospital data.

The model calculates time to diagnosis, costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and estimates the probability of the RDC being a cost-effective strategy. RESULTS: The RDC reduces mean time to diagnosis from 84.2 days in usual care to 5.9 days if a diagnosis is made at clinic, or 40.8 days if further investigations are booked during RDC. RDC provision is the superior strategy (that is, less costly and more effective) compared with standard clinical practice when run near or at full capacity.

Patient satisfaction is often linked to wait times. We describe a novel method to study workflow and simulate solutions to improve efficiency, thereby decreasing wait times and adding value. We implemented a real-time location system (RTLS) in our academic breast-imaging department to study workflow, including measuring patient wait time, quantifying equipment utilization, and identifying bottlenecks. Then, using discrete event simulation (DES), we modeled solutions with changes in staffing and equipment. Nine hundred and ninety-nine patient encounters were tracked over a 10-week period. The RTLS system recorded 551,512 raw staff and patient time stamps, which were analyzed to produce 17,042 staff and/or patient encounter time stamps. Mean patient wait time was 27 min. The digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) unit had the highest utilization rate and was identified as a bottleneck. DES predicts a 19.2% reduction in patient length of stay with replacement of a full field digital mammogram (FFDM) unit by a DBT unit and the addition of technologists. Through integration of RTLS with discrete event simulation testing, we created a model based on real-time data to accurately assess patient wait times and patient progress through an appointment, evaluate patient staff-interaction, identify system bottlenecks, and quantitate potential solutions.

Different methodological choices can be taken to design EPR. The study aimed to analyse whether, or not, and how changes in the methodology of EPR can impact medicine prices. METHODS: The real-life EPR methodology as of Q1/2015 was surveyed in all European Union Member States (where applicable), Iceland, Norway and Switzerland through a questionnaire responded by national pricing authorities. Different scenarios were developed related to the parameters of the EPR methodology. Discrete-event simulations of fictitious prices in the 28 countries of the study that had EPR were run over 10 years. The continuation of the real-life EPR methodology in the countries as surveyed in 2015, without any change, served as base case. RESULTS: In most scenarios, after 10 years, medicine prices in all or most surveyed countries were-sometimes considerably-lower than in the base case scenario. But in a few scenarios medicine prices increased in some countries. Consideration of discounts (an assumed 20% discount in five large economies and the mandatory discount in Germany, Greece and Ireland) and determining the reference price based on the lowest price in the country basket would result in higher price reductions (on average - 47.2% and - 34.2% compared to the base case). An adjustment of medicine price data of the reference countries by purchasing power parities would lead to higher prices in some more affluent countries (e.g. Switzerland, Norway) and lower prices in lower-income economies (Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland). Regular price revisions and changes in the basket of reference countries would also impact medicine prices, however to a lesser extent. CONCLUSIONS: EPR has some potential for cost-containment. Medicine prices could be decreased if certain parameters of the EPR methodology were changed. If public payers aim to apply EPR to keep medicine prices at more affordable levels, they are encouraged to explore the cost-containment potential of this policy by taking appropriate methodological choices in the EPR design.",2020-11-16,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:45:28,,51,,1,18,,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 33292293 PMCID: PMC7670789,,,,Cost control; Methodology; Pharmaceutical; Pricing policy; Yesp,0,1,1,0,None,0,Stata,0,,,,,,,,

However, the impact of transcatheter valve durability remains uncertain. METHODS: Discrete event simulation was used to model hypothetical scenarios of TAVR versus SAVR durability in which TAVR failure times were varied to determine the impact of TAVR valve durability on life expectancy in a cohort of low-risk patients similar to those in recent trials. Discrete event simulation modeling was used to estimate the tradeoff between a less invasive procedure with unknown valve durability (TAVR) and that of a more invasive procedure with known durability (SAVR). Standardized differences were calculated, and a difference >0.10 was considered clinically significant. In the base-case analysis, patients with structural valve deterioration requiring reoperation were assumed to undergo a valve-in-valve TAVR procedure. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the impact of TAVR valve durability on life expectancy in younger age groups (40, 50, and 60 years). RESULTS: Our cohort consisted of patients with aortic stenosis at low surgical risk with a mean age of 73.4±5.9 years. In the base-case scenario, the standardized difference in life expectancy was <0.10 between TAVR and SAVR until transcatheter valve prosthesis failure time was 70% shorter than that of surgical prostheses. At a transcatheter valve failure time <30% compared with surgical valves, SAVR was the preferred option. In younger patients, life expectancy was reduced when TAVR durability was 30%, 40%, and 50% shorter than that of surgical valves in 40-, 50-, and 60-year-old patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: According to our simulation models, the durability of TAVR valves must be 70% shorter than that of surgical valves to result in reduced life expectancy in patients with demographics similar to those of recent trials. However, in younger patients, this threshold for TAVR valve durability was substantially higher. These findings suggest that durability concerns should not influence the initial treatment decision concerning TAVR versus SAVR in older low-risk patients on the basis of current evidence supporting TAVR valve durability. However, in younger low-risk patients, valve durability must be weighed against other patient factors such as life expectancy.",2020-07-28,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:46:10,,354-364,,4,142,,Circulation,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 32493077,,,,"*Life Expectancy; *Prosthesis Failure; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aortic Valve Stenosis/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality/*surgery; Comorbidity; Female; heart valves; Humans; Male; Prognosis; prosthesis failure; Reoperation; Risk Factors; structural valve deterioration; Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement/*methods/standards/*statistics & numerical data; Treatment Outcome; Yesp",0,1,1,0,ISPOR,0,Treeage,0,,,,,,,,

Reacting to the pandemic and adaptation in the ""new normal"" have been challenging tasks. Exiting the pandemic can lead to some after-shock effects such as ""disruption tails."" While the research community has undertaken considerable efforts to predict the pandemic's impacts and examine supply chain adaptive behaviors during the pandemic, little is known about supply chain management in the course of pandemic elimination and post-disruption recovery. If capacity and inventory management are unaware of the after-shock risks, this can result in highly destabilized production-inventory dynamics and decreased performance in the post-disruption period causing product deficits in the markets and high inventory costs in the supply chains. In this paper, we use a discrete-event simulation model to investigate some exit strategies for a supply chain in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our model can inform managers about the existence and risk of disruption tails in their supply chains and guide the selection of post-pandemic recovery strategies. Our results show that supply chains with postponed demand and shutdown capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic are particularly prone to disruption tails. We then developed and examined two strategies to avoid these disruption tails. First, we observed a conjunction of recovery and supply chain coordination which mitigates the impact of disruption tails by demand smoothing over time in the post-disruption period. Second, we found a gradual capacity ramp-up prior to expected peaks of postponed demand to be an effective strategy for disruption tail control.",2021-04-05,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:41:20,,1-18,,,,,Ann Oper Res,,,,,,,,eng,© The Author(s) 2021.,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 33840871 PMCID: PMC8020368,,,,COVID-19 pandemic; Disruption tail; Ripple effect; Simulation; Supply chain dynamics; Supply chain resilience; Supply chain risk management; Yesp,0,1,1,0,None,1,anyLogistix,0,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to estimate p(nt) and w(t) as output variables by considering the number of healthcare resources employed and analyze the cost of health resources to the hospital depending on the cost coefficient (δ(i)) in an emergency department (ED). The integration of the discrete-event simulation (DES) model and machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and AdaBoost (AB), was used to calculate the estimation of the output variables depending on the δ(i) of resources cost. The AB algorithm performed best in almost all scenarios based on the results of the analysis. According to the AB algorithm based on the δ(0.0), δ(0.1), δ(0.2), and δ(0.3), the accuracy data were calculated as 0.9838, 0.9843, 0.9838, and 0.9846 for p(nt); 0.9514, 0.9517, 0.9514, and 0.9514 for w(t), respectively in the training stage.

All scenarios created by the δ(i) coefficient should be preferred for ED since the income provided by the p(nt) value to the hospital was more than the cost of healthcare resources. On the contrary, the w(t) estimation results of ML algorithms based on the δ(i) coefficient differed.

We used discrete event simulation (DES) modeling to test the theoretical impact of a proposed initiative to reduce diagnostic testing for low-acuity pediatric emergency department (ED) patients. METHODS: We modified an existing DES model, built at another large, urban, academic pediatric ED, to forecast the impact of reducing diagnostic testing rates on mean ED length of stay (LOS). The modified model included local testing rates for Emergency Severity Index (ESI) 4 and 5 patients and additional processes defined by local experts. Validation was performed by comparing model output predictions of mean LOS and wait times to actual site-specific data. We determined the goal reduction in diagnostic testing rates using the Achievable Benchmark of Care methodology. Model output mean LOS and wait times, with testing set at benchmark rates, were compared to outputs with testing set at current levels. RESULTS: During validation testing, model output metrics approximated actual clinical data with no statistically significant differences. Compared to model outputs with current testing rates, the mean LOS with testing set at an achievable benchmark was significantly shorter for ESI 4 (difference 19.1 mins [95% confidence interval 12.2, 26.0]) patients. CONCLUSION: A DES model predicted a statistically significant decrease in mean LOS for ESI 4 pediatric ED patients if diagnostic testing is performed at an achievable benchmark rate compared to current rates.

It is widely agreed, that such models can be augmented with realistic multiscale population models and by incorporating human mobility patterns. Nevertheless, a large proportion of recent studies, aimed at better understanding global epidemics, like influenza, measles, H1N1, SARS, and COVID-19, underestimate the role of heterogeneous mixing in populations, characterized by strong social structures and geography. Motivated by the reduced tractability of studies employing homogeneous mixing, which make conclusions hard to deduce, we propose a new, very fine-grained model incorporating the spatial distribution of population into geographical settlements, with a hierarchical organization down to the level of households (inside which we assume homogeneous mixing). In addition, population is organized heterogeneously outside households, and we model the movement of individuals using travel distance and frequency parameters for inter- and intra-settlement movement. Discrete event simulation, employing an adapted SIR model with relapse, reproduces important qualitative characteristics of real epidemics, like high variation in size and temporal heterogeneity (e.g., waves), that are challenging to reproduce and to quantify with existing measures. Our results pinpoint an important aspect, that epidemic size is more sensitive to the increase in distance of travel, rather that the frequency of travel.

This study aimed to evaluate the economic value of new AEDs in the treatment of focal onset seizure, with or without secondary generalization, in Finnish adults and adolescents with epilepsy, comparing brivaracetam with perampanel as adjunctive AEDs. METHODS: Economic value was assessed using cost-utility analysis. Periods of AED initiation, titration, response assessment (seizure freedom, ≥ 50% reduction, no response), switching in no response or treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and death were simulated using a discrete-event simulation model. Responses and switching were simulated based on a comprehensive Bayesian network meta-analysis. The primary modeled outcome was the 3%/year discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), payer costs (year 2017 Euro) per patient, and net monetary benefit (NMB) were secondary outcomes. Probabilistic and comprehensive deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Brivaracetam was more efficacious and had fewer TEAEs than perampanel and other AEDs. Modeled average 5-year QALYs and costs were 3.671 and €28,297 for brivaracetam and 3.611 and €27,979 for perampanel, respectively. The resulting ICER for brivaracetam versus perampanel was only €5345/QALY gained in a deterministic base case scenario. Brivaracetam had a positive NMB and high probability of cost-effectiveness of €1190 and 71% or €1944 and 80% with the assumed willingness to pay of €25,358 or €38,036/QALY gained, respectively. The primary result was robust, with a positive NMB persistent in all sensitivity analysis scenarios. When switching from brivaracetam to perampanel was excluded from the modeling or switching from perampanel to brivaracetam was included, brivaracetam was cost-saving and more effective than perampanel (dominant). CONCLUSION: These simulated comparisons demonstrated that brivaracetam was more effective and potentially also more affordable than perampanel. Thus, brivaracetam is likely a cost-effective and net beneficial alternative to perampanel for treatment of focal onset seizures.

This surge in death necessitates identification of resource needs and relies on modelling resource and understanding anticipated surges in demand. Our aim was to develop a generic computer model that could estimate resources required for end-of-life (EoL) care delivery during the pandemic. SETTING: A discrete event simulation model was developed and used to estimate resourcing needs for a geographical area in the South West of England. While our analysis focused on the UK setting, the model is flexible to changes in demand and setting. PARTICIPANTS: We used the model to estimate resourcing needs for a population of around 1 million people. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The model predicts the per-day 'staff' and 'stuff' resourcing required to meet a given level of incoming EoL care activity. RESULTS: A mean of 11.97 hours of additional community nurse time, up to 33 hours of care assistant time and up to 30 hours additional care from care assistant night sits will be required per day as a result of out of hospital COVID-19 deaths based on the model prediction. Specialist palliative care demand is predicted to increase up to 19 hours per day. An additional 286 anticipatory medicine bundles per month will be necessary to alleviate physical symptoms at the EoL care for patients with COVID-19: an average additional 10.21 bundles of anticipatory medication per day. An average additional 9.35 syringe pumps could be needed to be in use per day.

This study combines Digital Human Modelling (DHM) and Discrete Event Simulation (DES) to address the need for tools to better manage MSD risk. This novel approach quantifies physical-workload, work-performance, and quality-of-care, in response to varying geographical patient-bed assignments, patient-acuity levels, and nurse-patient ratios. Lumbar loads for 86 care-delivery tasks in an acute care hospital unit were used as inputs in a DES model of the care-delivery process, creating a shift-long time trace of the biomechanical load.

Within the process of building a multicriteria evaluation model, meetings, interviews, and a decision conference were designed. In parallel, a workflow discrete event simulation model was built to replicate current patient flow and activities and to reproduce the impact of implementing improvement measures and variations in human resources. RESULTS: Four evaluation criteria were considered for workflow improvement: contribution to the efficiency of the admission process, compliance with schedules, agility among procedures, and human resources training. The designed improvement measures sought to 1) improve the start-up of the day, 2) improve pre-exam assessment, and 3) improve staff training. Results prioritize 'Measure 2' and demonstrate that improving human resources allocation increases efficiency and offers significant cost savings. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed solution is in line with VBHC principles, as it improves efficiency and care delivery while optimizing costs.

METHODS: A comprehensive combination method involving Discrete Event Simulation (DES), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm, and finally solving the model by use of Genetic Algorithm (GA) was used in this study. After simulating the case and making sure about the validity of the model, experiments were designed to study the effects of change in individuals and equipment on the average time that patients wait, as well as units' engagement in ED. Objective functions determined using Artificial Neural Network algorithm and MATLAB software were used to train it. Finally, after estimating objective functions and adding related constraints to the problem, a fractional Genetic Algorithm was used to solve the model. RESULTS: According to the model optimization result, it was determined that the hospitalization unit, as well as the hospitalization units' doctors, were in an optimized condition, but the triage unit, as well as the fast track units' doctors, should be optimized.

The mainstay of therapy for NP-C patients with neurological symptoms is miglustat, a drug that may modify the course of the disease. AIM: Our aim was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of miglustat in comparison to symptomatic therapy in patients with NP-C in the socio-economic settings of the Republic of Serbia, an upper-middle-income European economy. METHOD: The perspective of the Serbian Republic Health Insurance Fund was chosen for this study, and the time horizon was eighty years. The main outcomes of the study were quality-adjusted life years gained with miglustat and comparator, and direct costs of treatment. The study was conducted through the generation and simulation of the Discrete-Event Simulation model. The model results were obtained after Monte Carlo microsimulation of a sample with 1000 virtual patients. RESULTS: Treatment with miglustat was not cost-effective when compared with symptomatic therapy and was associated with negative values of net monetary benefit regardless of the onset of neurological manifestations (- 110,447,627.00 ± 701,614.00 RSD, - 343,871,695.00 ± 2,577,441.00 RSD, - 1,397,908,502.00 ± 23,084,235.00 RSD and - 2,953,680,879.00 ± 33,297,412.00 RSD) for early infantile, late infantile, juvenile and adolescent cohorts, respectively). CONCLUSION: When traditional pharmacoeconomic evaluation is employed, miglustat is not a cost-effective option in comparison to symptomatic therapy for the treatment of NP-C.

METHODS: The event-specific distributions (ESDs) approach sampled times from event-specific time-to-event distributions and simulated the first event to occur. The unimodal distribution and regression approach sampled a time from a combined unimodal time-to-event distribution, representing all events, and used a (multinomial) logistic regression model to select the event to be simulated. A simulation study assessed performance in terms of relative absolute event incidence difference and relative entropy of time-to-event distributions for different types and levels of right censoring, numbers of events, distribution overlap, and sample sizes. Differences in cost-effectiveness estimates were illustrated in a colorectal cancer case study. RESULTS: Increased levels of censoring negatively affected the modeling approaches' performance. A lower number of competing events and higher overlap of distributions improved performance. When IPD were censored at random times, ESD performed best. When censoring occurred owing to a maximum follow-up time for 2 events, ESD performed better for a low level of censoring (ie, 10%). For 3 or 4 competing events, ESD better represented the probabilities of events, whereas unimodal distribution and regression better represented the time to events. Differences in cost-effectiveness estimates, both compared with no censoring and between approaches, increased with increasing censoring levels. CONCLUSIONS: Modelers should be aware of the different modeling approaches available and that selection between approaches may be informed by data characteristics.

It has shown efficiency benefits as it allows parallel processing of patients in a dedicated block room (BR). However, granular quantification of these benefits to hospital operations is lacking. The goal of this study was to determine the financial effect of establishing a BR using comprehensive operational modeling. METHODS: A discrete-event simulation model of daily operating room (OR) patient flow for TJA procedures at a mid-sized hospital was developed. Two scenarios were tested: (1) without and (2) with a BR. Scenarios were compared according to staffing requirements, hours/day, and labor costs. The number of ORs and cases varied from 2 to 6 ORs performing 3 to 5 cases. These results were used as the inputs of a discounted cash flow (CF) model. Discounted CF model outputs were CF, net present value, internal rate of return, and return on investment. RESULTS: Mean time savings of incorporating a BR were 68 min/d (range: 30 to 80 min/d), reducing the OR closing time by 1 hour. Incremental labor costs/day from nurse overtime pay ranged from $2,025 to $10,125 with no BR and $1,595 to $9,045 with a BR, which resulted in an increase in profit/day from $360 to $1,605. The CF/annum was $54,363, the net present value was $213,082, the internal rate of return was 12%, and the return on investment was 43.61%. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates that under all scenarios, a BR is more profitable than no BR to a hospital performing TJA via a bundled care or private payer remuneration model. A BR was shown to be financially net positive even when considering the necessary financial investment to establish it. In addition, this study demonstrates the potential of combining discrete-event simulation with financial analyses to assess various operational models of care to improve hospital efficiency, such as dedicated trauma rooms and swing rooms.

Interdisciplinary treatment teams therefore often face the challenge of balancing the benefits of early kidney transplantation and the risk of metastatic progression. Hence, we compared the quality-adjusted life expectancy of different management strategies in kidney failure patients diagnosed with active surveillance-eligible prostate cancer during pretransplantation workup. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A discrete event simulation model was developed on the basis of a systematic literature search, clinical guidelines, and expert opinion. After model validation and calibration, we simulated four management strategies in a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 patients: Definitive treatment (surgery or radiation therapy) and listing after a waiting period of 2 years, definitive treatment and immediate listing, active surveillance and listing after a waiting period of 2 years, and active surveillance and immediate listing. Individual patient results (quality-adjusted life years; QALYs) were aggregated into strategy-specific means (± SEs). RESULTS: Active surveillance and immediate listing yielded the highest amount of quality-adjusted life expectancy (6.97 ± 0.01 QALYs) followed by definitive treatment and immediate listing (6.75 ± 0.01 QALYs). These two strategies involving immediate listing not only outperformed those incorporating a waiting period of 2 years (definitive treatment: 6.32 ± 0.01 QALYs; active surveillance: 6.59 ± 0.01 QALYs) but also yielded a higher proportion of successfully performed transplantations (72% and 74% versus 56% and 59%), with less time on hemodialysis on average (4.02 and 3.81 years versus 4.80 and 4.65 years).

This study focused on gaining insight into how nurses can be assigned to units in a perinatology care system to balance patient demand with the available nurses. Discrete event simulation was used to evaluate the what-if analysis of nurse flexibility strategies and care system configurations from a case study of the Perinatology Care System at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Decisions to exercise nurse flexibility strategies to solve supply-demand mismatches were made by considering the entire patient care trajectory perspective, as they necessitate a coherence perspective (i.e., taking the interdependency between departments into account). The study results showed that in the current care system configuration, where care is delivered in six independent units, implementing a nurse flexibility strategy based on skill requirements was the best solution, averaging two fewer under-/overstaffed nurses per shift in the care system. However, exercising flexibility below or above a certain limit did not substantially improve the performance of the system. To meet the actual demand in the studied setting (70 beds), the ideal range of flexibility was between 7% and 20% of scheduled nurses per shift. When the care system was configured differently (i.e., into two large departments or pooling units into one large department), supply-demand mismatches were also minimized without having to implement any of the three nurse flexibility strategies mentioned in this study. These results provide insights into the possible solutions that can be implemented to deal with nurse shortages, given that these shortages could potentially worsen in the coming years.",2022-05-17,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:32:19,,,,5,10,,Healthcare (Basel),,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 35628062 PMCID: PMC9141075,,,,capacity management; flexibility; hospital care system; inpatient wards; nurses; Yesp,0,1,1,0,None,0,Matlab,0,,,,,,,,

We estimated the cost-effectiveness of higher rates of guideline-based care, compared with current practice. METHODS: The costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with current practice (30% of patients receiving guideline-based care) were compared with seven hypothetical scenarios with increasing proportion of guideline-based care (40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 100%). Comparisons were made using discrete event simulations reflecting the natural history of DFU over a 3-year time horizon from the Australian healthcare perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for each scenario and compared to a willingness-to-pay of AUD 28,000 per QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to incorporate joint parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: All seven scenarios with higher rates of guideline-based care were likely cheaper and more effective than current practice. Increased proportions compared with current practice resulted in between AUD 0.28 and 1.84 million in cost savings and 11-56 additional QALYs per 1000 patients. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that the finding is robust to parameter uncertainty.

We aimed to develop a simulation model to estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival for first-line doublet chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab for specific subgroups of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients based on registry data. METHODS: Data from 867 patients were used to develop two survival models and one logistic regression model that populated a discrete event simulation (DES). Discrimination and calibration were used for internal validation of these models separately and predicted and observed medians and Kaplan-Meier plots were compared for the integrated DES. Bootstrapping was performed to correct for optimism in the internal validation and to generate correlated sets of model parameters for use in a probabilistic analysis to reflect parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: The survival models showed good calibration based on the regression slopes and modified Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics at 1 and 2 years, but not for short-term predictions at 0.5 years. Modified C-statistics indicated acceptable discrimination. The simulation estimated that median first-line PFS (95% confidence interval) of 219 (25%) patients could be improved from 175 days (156-199) to 269 days (246-294) if treatment would be targeted based on the highest expected PFS.

Thus, more effective operating room management and scheduling can provide significant benefits. In many hospitals, the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), where patients recover after their surgical procedures, is a bottleneck. If the PACU reaches capacity, patients must wait in the operating room until the PACU has available space, leading to delays and possible cancellations for subsequent operating room procedures. We develop a generalizable optimization and machine learning approach to sequence operating room procedures to minimize delays caused by PACU unavailability. Specifically, we use machine learning to estimate the required PACU time for each type of surgical procedure, we develop and solve two integer programming models to schedule procedures in the operating rooms to minimize maximum PACU occupancy, and we use discrete event simulation to compare our optimized schedule to the existing schedule. Using data from Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford, we show that the scheduling system can significantly reduce operating room delays caused by PACU congestion while still keeping operating room utilization high: simulation of the second half of 2016 shows that our model could have reduced total PACU holds by 76% without decreasing operating room utilization.

Determining the median age at causal HPV infection and CIN2+ diagnosis based on the natural history of HPV disease can help elucidate the incidence of HPV infections and the potential benefits of vaccination in mid-adults. METHODS: Real-world data on CIN2+ diagnosis from the prevaccine era were sourced from a statewide surveillance registry in Connecticut. Age distribution of CIN2+ diagnosis in 2008 and 2009 was estimated. A discrete event simulation model was developed to predict the age distribution of causal HPV infection. The optimal age distribution of causal HPV infection provided the best goodness-of-fit statistic to compare the predicted vs real-world age distribution of CIN2+ diagnosis. RESULTS: The median age at CIN2+ diagnosis from 2008 through 2009 in Connecticut was 28 years. The predicted median age at causal HPV infection was estimated to be 23.9 years. There was a difference of 5.2 years in the median age at acquisition of causal HPV infection and the median age at CIN2+ diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Real-world data on CIN2+ diagnosis and model-based analysis indicate a substantial burden of infection and disease among women aged 27 years or older, which supports the ACIP recommendation to vaccinate some mid-adults.

DESIGN: Directed acyclic graphs were used to define explicitly the causal relationship among organ systems and specific treatments used. A hybrid approach of agent-based modeling, discrete-event simulation, and Bayesian network was used to simulate treatment effect across multiple stages and interactions of major organ systems (cardiovascular, neurologic, renal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, inflammatory, and hematology). Organ systems were visualized using relevant clinical markers. The application was iteratively revised and debugged by clinical experts and engineers. Agreement statistics was used to test the performance of the model by comparing the observed patient response versus the expected response (primary and secondary) predicted by digital twin. SETTING: Medical ICU of a large quaternary- care academic medical center in the United States. PATIENTS OR SUBJECTS: Adult (> 18 year yr old), medical ICU patients were included in the study. INTERVENTIONS: No additional interventions were made beyond the standard of care for this study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During the verification phase, model performance was prospectively tested on 145 observations in a convenience sample of 29 patients. Median age was 60 years (54-66 d) with a median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 9.5 (interquartile range, 5.0-14.0). The most common source of sepsis was pneumonia, followed by hepatobiliary. The observations were made during the first 24 hours of the ICU admission with one-step interventions, comparing the output in the digital twin with the real patient response. The agreement between the observed versus and the expected response ranged from fair (kappa coefficient of 0.41) for primary response to good (kappa coefficient of 0.65) for secondary response to the intervention. The most common error detected was coding error in 50 observations (35%), followed by expert rule error in 29 observations (20%) and timing error in seven observations (5%). CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the feasibility of development and prospective testing of causal artificial intelligence model to predict the response to treatment in early stages of critical illness.

This is especially true for the inpatient surgical department where complex and long surgeries are often performed along with surgeries on emergency patients. This paper aims to improve the scheduling of the inpatient department by partitioning the elective surgeries into the more predictable surgeries (MPS) group and the less predictable surgeries (LPS) group, based on surgery duration variability, and by scheduling each of the two surgery groups in different ORs. Through a simulation study that comprehensively investigates the impact of the partitioning on different performance measures under various environmental settings, we report important findings and insights. First, partitioning can effectively shorten the waiting times of elective patients for both MPS and LPS groups, but the option should be allowed to reassign patients from the MPS or LPS ORs to the other ORs when needed. Meanwhile, partitioning sometimes slightly increases the elective cancellation rate. Second, the ability to use the available capacity of the ORs as much as possible is key to reducing elective waiting times. Third, partitioning might slightly worsen the waiting times of emergency patients, while the slightly negative impact on emergency patients decreases when the number of ORs is higher. Fourth, the beneficial impact of partitioning on elective patients increases with an increased patient demand. Last, for the settings considered in this study there was no benefit in partitioning the elective patients into more than two groups.",2022-06-02,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:53:29,,,,,,,Health Care Manag Sci,,,,,,,,eng,"© 2022.

As a long-term consequence of cartilage defects, osteoarthritis can develop over time, often leading to the need for a total knee replacement (TKR). The treatment alternatives of chondral defects include, among others, microfracture, and matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation (M-ACI). The purpose of this study was to determine cost-effectiveness of M-ACI in Germany with available mid- and long-term outcome data, with special focus on the avoidance of TKR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a discrete-event simulation (DES) that follows up individuals with cartilage defects of the knee over their lifetimes. The DES was conducted with a status-quo scenario in which M-ACI is available and a comparison scenario with no M-ACI available. The model included 10,000 patients with articular cartilage defects. We assumed Weibull distributions for short- and long-term effects for implant failures. Model outcomes were costs, number of TKRs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). All analyses were performed from the perspective of the German statutory health insurance. RESULTS: The majority of patients was under 45 years old, with defect sizes between 2 and 7 cm(2) (mean: 4.5 cm(2)); average modeled lifetime was 48 years. In the scenario without M-ACI, 26.4% of patients required a TKR over their lifetime. In the M-ACI scenario, this was the case in only 5.5% of cases. Thus, in the modeled cohort of 10,000 patients, 2700 TKRs, including revisions, could be avoided. Patients treated with M-ACI experienced improved quality of life (22.53 vs. 21.21 QALYs) at higher treatment-related costs (18,589 vs. 14,134 € /patient) compared to those treated without M-ACI, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 3376 € /QALY. CONCLUSION: M-ACI is projected to be a highly cost-effective treatment for chondral defects of the knee in the German healthcare setting.",2022-01-22,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:48:47,,,,,,,Arch Orthop Trauma Surg,,,,,,,,eng,© 2021.

METHODS: We used discrete-event simulation to estimate outcomes for 2 scenarios: stroke system of care with enabling technology (mobile stroke unit, stroke team expansion) and stroke system of care with no enabling technology, as compared with the status quo. We considered patient flow from symptom recognition to treatment. Patient locations and stroke events were generated for the 92 Indiana counties in Indiana, subdivided into 1009 locations. We considered time from emergency medical service (EMS) arrival at onset to treatment, probability of tissue plasminogen activator administered within 3 h of onset, and percentage of patients admitted beyond the occupancy level at the comprehensive stroke center. RESULTS: Results varied by urbanicity. Under no enabling technology, having a stroke system of care improved outcomes for individuals in urban and suburban settings. However, in rural settings, the implementation of stroke system of care guidelines decreased the average rate of treatment within 3 h of stroke onset and increased the EMS arrival to treatment times compared with sending the individual to the closest provider. Enabling technologies improved outcomes regardless of setting. DISCUSSION: Geographic disparities tend to increase the number of transfers, decrease the rate of treatment within 3 h of onset, and increase transit time.

In an IPU, the different providers circulate among the patients, according to the need for their expertise, while patients remain in a single location once they check-in. From the patient's perspective, the benefits of such an arrangement should be self-evident. For payers and providers there will also be benefits as the fee-for-service market gives way to structured payments for each episode of care. Before setting up an IPU, it is necessary to gain an understanding of how available resources will limit patient flow and system performance. Treating resources such as providers, imaging equipment, and rooms parametrically, the primary goal of our work is to determine the number of patients that can be seen per day in an IPU while trying to constrain overtime, length of stay, and waiting time to best practice targets. Discrete-event simulation serves as our analytic tool. While we are involved in the design of a comprehensive suite of musculoskeletal IPUs, we illustrate our approach with an extensive computational study of one: a Lower Extremity Joint Pain IPU. Using the simulation methodology, we are not only able to determine the number of patients that can be scheduled for an in-clinic visit each day, but also the daily number of follow-up patients that can be served virtually through telemedicine with no additional resources and minimal impact on IPU performance. These results assisted the Department of Surgery at the Dell Medical School at The University of Texas in the optimal design of its first IPU, which opened in the fall of 2017.",2019-02-17,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:33:18,,293-316,,4,9,,Health Syst (Basingstoke),,,,,,,,eng,© 2019 Operational Research Society.,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 33354322 PMCID: PMC7738287,,,,integrated practice unit; Outpatient clinic; patient scheduling; patient-centred care; simulation; virtual medicine; Yesp,0,1,1,0,None,0,Simio,0,,,,,,,,

Agencies have developed policies to test donors and to extend inter-donation intervals (IDIs) for individuals with low ferritin levels. Ferritin testing, however, has an impact on product availability due to longer IDIs and the effect of test results on donor behaviour. In this paper we apply a model to evaluate the impact of ferritin testing in the Canadian donor population on whole blood donations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A discrete event simulation was adopted for the study. The model represents a population of individuals that donate blood, are tested for ferritin levels, and may exit the system. Data for the simulation was derived from operational data, donor research studies from Canadian Blood Services and previously published sources. RESULTS: Red cell collections will decline by at least 3.1% and could decline by as much as 19.2% after ferritin testing is put in place. Requirements for new donors could rise by as much as 36.0%. CONCLUSION: The impact of ferritin testing on repeat donor behaviour, rather than extensions to the mandated inter-donation interval, is the largest factor influencing declines in whole blood donations. Because behaviour changes following the receipt of a low ferritin result, blood agencies must ensure that donors with low ferritin are motivated to modify their lifestyle and, when healthy, return to the donor pool.",2022-01,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 15:10:52,,17-26,,1,117,,Vox Sang,,,,,,,,eng,© 2021 International Society of Blood Transfusion.,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 34060092,,,,"*Anemia, Iron-Deficiency; *Ferritins; anaemia; blood donation; Blood Donors; Canada; Humans; Iron; simulation; Yesp",0,1,1,1,None,0,Excel,0,,,,,,,,

With a view to planning population-wide interventions, the question arises how prevalence can be calculated if the distribution of a risk-factor in the population shifts. To study the impact of such possible interventions, it is important to deal with the resulting changes of risk-factors that affect the rates in the IDM. The aim of this work is to show how the PDE can be used to study such effects on the age-specific prevalence of a chronic disease, to demonstrate its applicability and to compare the results to a discrete event simulation (DES), a frequently used simulation technique. This is done for the first time based on the PDE which only needs data on population-wide epidemiological indices and is related to the von Foerster equation. In a simulation study, we analyse the effect of a hypothetical intervention against type 2 diabetes. We compare the age-specific prevalence obtained from a DES with the results predicted from modifying the rates in the PDE. The DES is based on 10000 subjects and estimates the effect of changes in the distributions of risk-factors. With respect to the PDE, the change of the distribution of risk factors is synthesized to an effective rate that can be used directly in the PDE. Both methods, DES and effective rate method (ERM) are capable of predicting the impact of the hypothetical intervention. The age-specific prevalences resulting from the DES and the ERM are consistent. Although DES is common in simulating effects of hypothetical interventions, the ERM is a suitable alternative. ERM fits well into the analytical theory of the IDM and the related PDE and comes with less computational effort.",2019,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 15:06:41,,e0226554,,12,14,,PLoS One,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 31846478 PMCID: PMC6917280,,,,"*Death; *Models, Statistical; Chronic Disease/*epidemiology; Humans; Incidence; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Yesp",0,1,1,1,None,0,R,1,,,,,,,,

Simulation provides a powerful tool to fine-tune policies and investigate their impact before any costly intervention. METHODS: A hospital-wide discrete event simulation is developed to model incoming flow from ED and elective units in a busy metropolitan hospital. The impacts of two different policies are investigated using this simulation model: (i) varying inpatient bed configurations and a load sharing strategy among a cluster of wards within a medical department and (ii) early discharge strategies on inpatient bed access. Several clinically relevant bed configurations and early discharge scenarios are defined and their impact on key performance metrics are quantified. RESULTS: Sharing beds between wards reduced the average and total ED length of stay (LOS) by 21% compared to having patients queue for individual wards. The current baseline performance level could be maintained by using fewer beds when the load sharing approach was imposed. Earlier discharge of inpatients resulted in reducing average patient ED LOS by approximately 16% and average patient waiting time by 75%. Specific time-based discharge targets led to greater improvements in flow compared to blanket approaches of discharging all patients 1 or 2 hours earlier. CONCLUSIONS: ED access performance for admitted patients can be improved by modifying downstream capacity or inpatient discharge times. The simulation model was able to quantify the potential impacts of such policies on patient flow and to provide insights for future strategic planning.,2022-11-14,2022-11-18 15:11:51,2022-11-19 14:51:53,,,,,,,Emerg Med Australas,,,,,,,,eng,"© 2022 Commonwealth of Australia.
