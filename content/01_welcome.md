# Preface

These results accompany **Harper and Monks (2023).  DES model sharing in healthcare: an analysis of the published literature 2019-2022**

> An early version of these results was presented at the WSC2022 conference for the panel on **Grand Challenges in Healthcare Simulation**.  Thanks goes to Prof Christine Currie for her support.

## Aim and research questions:

The overarching research aim is determine to what extent authors of DES health studies share models and where models are shared how is this done.

### Primary research questions:

1. What proportion of DES healthcare papers that share their models and code?
2. What proportion of these papers that use Free and Open Source Simulation and of these what number are shared?
3. What proportion of these papers that tackle covid-19 and share their models?
3. Do these metrics vary by the type of article: journal paper, full conference paper or book chapter?
4. How have these metrics changed in over the three years of the study?
5. What proportion of studies make use of a reporting guideline?
6. What methods, tools, and resources did authors use to share their models and code?
7. To what extent do the DES health community follow best practice for open science when sharing models?
8. To what extent can the healthcare DES community improve its sharing of models?
