# Background

In healthcare, discrete-event simulation (DES) is a widely used methodology for modelling of patient care pathways, health service delivery, and health technology assessment. It has used in areas such as stroke care (cite netherlands paper in BMJ open), emergency departments (cite sim ED review in BMJ open?), drug cost-effectiveness, sexual health (cite BMJ open paper we found), reducing delayed discharges (cite IPACs and Marion), mental health, ICU, and end of life care (cite Dan's BMJ open).  One review found DES to be the most common modelling technique in health {citre:p}`salleh2017simulation`. Healthcare DES models are often complex research artefacts: they are inherently difficult to describe and to share them    

In this paper, we sought to understand patterns of DES model sharing in healthcare. We analysed a dataset of XXXXXXX publications applying DES in healthcare to determine ....stuff

For simulation models to be shared, re-used, modified, replicated, or evaluated, it is important that they are made available in a way that is comprehensible, transparent, and executable. \cite{10.1145/2812803} outlined *repeatability* and *benefaction* as two key reasons for sharing models or code. While some limited attention has been given to the need for simulation study results to be repeatable or reproducible in OR \citep{taylor2018crisis, uhrmacher2016panel}, the advantages of sharing for benefaction have received very little focus. Benefaction allows other researchers to build on results, better advancing scientific progress by avoiding unnecessary replication of work and providing opportunities for learning \citep{taylor2017open}.

It is well documented that sharing of model code and files has historically been poor in modelling and simulation. \cite{janssen2017practice} found that 10\% of over 2300 articles made source code available for publication. \cite{janssen2020code} extended this analysis to 7500 articles of agent-based models, reporting that only 11\%  of articles shared code, although there is an upward trend: 18\% of publications were found to share their model in some form by 2018. Nonetheless, at the start of the coronavirus pandemic the lack of transparency and access to epidemiological model code used to inform economic and public health policy contributed to public confusion and polarisation \citep{doi:10.1126/science.abb8637}.

Even where source code is provided in research studies, it may not be executable due to changing dependencies \citep{rawal2022survey}, or where not permanently archived, code may become unavailable \citep{janssen2020code}. Where models are recorded as 'available upon request', requests for code are frequently not honoured, even in journals demanding reproducibility \citep{stodden2018empirical, 10.1145/2812803}. \cite{janssen2020code} received a response from less than 1\% of authors to provide their code; the majority of these indicated that their model is no longer available, or failed to provide a runnable version. 

Efforts to encourage authors to submit model code alongside the published articles that describe the results have been promoted in disciplines allied to OR. For example, the ACM Reproducibility Task Force was created in 2015 to address the difficulty of installing and running experimental software and data (https://www.acm.org/publications/task-force-on-data-software-and-reproducibility). The Turing Way \citep{the_turing_way_community_2022_7470333} started as a guide to reproducibility in 2019, with the goal of providing the information needed by researchers and data scientists in academia, industry and the public sector to ensure that their projects are easy to reproduce and reuse. CoMSES Net, the Network for Computational Modeling in Social and Ecological Sciences, has a broader goal of improving sharing, use, and re-use of agent based and computational models for the study of social and ecological systems, maintaining a digital repository that supports discovery and good practices for digital preservation, reproducibility, and reuse. Similarly, the Open Modeling Foundation (https://www.openmodelingfoundation.org) expresses the aim of improving social, biomedical, ecological, environmental, and geophysical modelling sciences by making models more easily discoverable and accessible. It promotes common standards and technology for models that are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable \citep{barton2022make}.

Methods and technology for sharing computational resources and data in the open web environment are changing rapidly. Yet in the OR simulation community, in particular in healthcare, there appears to be limited research, application, guidance, or incentive to share models or code. In healthcare, similar processes and problems exist across systems and services which are often amenable to generic solutions \citep{furian2018gedmod}. Yet even studies that develop and promote a generalisable model often fail to make the model available to health service researchers or analysts for reuse or modification \citep{mahdavi2013generic}. 

The use of reporting guidelines remains similarly sporadic. Guidelines such as Strengthening the Reporting of Empirical Simulation Studies \citep[STRESS]{monks2019strengthening} provide researchers with a structured tool to ensure the minimum necessary information is reported in a simulation study, including a code access statement. The culture for sharing data, software, and metadata; adhering to community established standards and practices for model transparency and reuse; and addressing theoretical and methodological practices for sharing is not keeping pace with that of other simulation and computational domains \citep{monks2022open, taylor2017open}.
