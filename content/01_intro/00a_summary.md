This study looked at how computer models are shared in health services and health economic studies that use a method called discrete-event simulation. The researchers searched several databases to find studies that focused on cost-effectiveness, health service research, and methodology studies in a health context. They found that only a small percentage of studies shared their computer models, and even fewer followed best practices for sharing. However, they did find that studies were more likely to share models if they were developed using free and open source tools. The researchers suggest that the healthcare community can adopt simple best practices to improve the quality of sharing. Overall, this study shows that while healthcare authors are increasingly sharing their computer model artifacts, there is still room for improvement in sharing practices.
