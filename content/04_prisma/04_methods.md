# Methods

This is a work in progress.

## 5. Eligibility Criteria

The inclusion and exclusion criteria are specified within the methods chapter in [Inclusion](../02_methods/02_inclusion) and [Data Extraction](../02_methods/03_extraction) sections.

## 6. Information sources

The databases used in the study were ACM Digital Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Pubmed Central.  The dates of the last search for each database was the 09/03/2023.  Details are listed in the [Search Strategy](../02_methods/01_search_strategy) section.

## 7. Search strategy

We have provided full search strings for each [database](../02_methods/01_search_strategy)

## 8. Selection process

We have provided full details on the process our two reviewers used to select each study in the section on [Study selection](../02_methods/02_inclusion)

## 9. Data collection process

**To do**:

* Random sample to re-review/cross-review.

## 10. Data items

We split our review into two parts: data extraction from all papers included, and a more detailed best practice audit of those studies that did share their models and code that would allow us to critically appraise practice.  

### 10a. Primary outcomes

We list all information extracted in first part of our review in the [Data Extraction](../02_methods/03_extraction) section.  For our subset analysis, we provide a detailed discussion and presentation of our criteria in [Best Practice Audit](../02_methods/04_quality_audit) section.

### 10b. Other variables

We collected additional variables in the first part of our review and these are also listed within [Data Extraction](../02_methods/03_extraction).  Our focus here was on the platform for sharing and if the studies used a reporting guideline.

## 11. Study risk of bias assessment

Not applicable.

## 12. Effect measures

Not applicable.

## 13 Synthesis methods

### 13a 

### 13b Data preparation

### 13c Methods for tabulation and visualisation

### 13d Methods used to synthesise results

### 13e Methods to explore heterogeneity

We split our analysis by publication type i.e. journal articles, full paper conference proceedings, and book chapters.  

### 13f Sensitivity analyses

The main result of number of models shared is broken down by year.

## 14. Reporting bias assessment

Not applicable? **To discuss**

## 15. Certainty assessment

Not applicable.
